Lubricant
Slip and slide
Nobody's machines are perfect, not even your own. Inevitable friction between moving parts stops your devices from working to their maximum capacity - that's where Lubricant comes in. It will ensure a connected machine will run at full throttle, <config;d;autolubricant_speedup>x its base speed. <link;immersivepetroleum:pumpjack;§n§oPumpjacks§r>, <link;excavator;§n§oExcavators§r>, and <link;crusher;§n§oCrushers§r> can all be lubricated.
<&lubricant1>The Lubricant Can can be used to manually apply a lubricating fluid to a machine. Petroleum Lubricant is the most effective, but <link;squeezer;§n§oPlant Oil§r> also works. Once the can is full, simply right click on a valid block to lubricate it. While sped up, the machine will visibly drip.
Iron Golems may also be lubricated, healing them and temporarily increasing their speed and strength.

A <link;chemthrower;§o§nChemical §o§nThrower§r> can also be used to apply a lubricant to blocks, albeit less efficiently. Simply spray a valid lubricant fluid onto a machine and it will begin to operate at full speed.
