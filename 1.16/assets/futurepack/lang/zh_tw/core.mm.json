	"After a great deal of research, I have finally succeeded in finding a material superior to silicon in the processor housing. After numerous failed experiments, I was able to develop a quantum processor. It is based on Quantanium elements that can be configured for many functions.",
	"The individual information units inside can be entangled in such a way that when one changes, it influences another unit. This allows the processor to apply complex operations to arbitrarily large amounts of data, whereupon the results of the calculation can be seen nearly immediately. The performance limits of the processors are managed mainly by reconfiguring the operation settings.",
	"Inputs and outputs are communicated to and from the system via light, allowing information to be shared far faster than electrical signals, and glowtite is particularly suitable for this. The individual arithmetic units are composed of and limited by more optical-friendly elements, which I can best make from diamonds.",
