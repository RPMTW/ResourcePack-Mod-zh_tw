    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.belt_of_the_starved.1": "The arcana I collect occasionally have scraps of wishes and desires woven in. Often, given the base nature of what I reap, this comes in the form of hunger, lust, or petty grudges. All of these impurities can be harnessed, and beyond that, I can infuse this power into my magic.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.belt_of_the_starved.2": "Doing this carries the perhaps predictable effect that my own hunger amplifies, draining quicker in the process. And... by eating things which revile me, things which are rotten, this powerful effect is extended beyond it's natural duration. The magic proficiency this grants is immense, but... I must say, the means are rather distasteful.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.belt_of_the_starved.ring_of_desperate_voracity.1": "To combat the toxic nature of these foods, I have created a ring to alleviate some of these effects. This ring makes rotten foods just a little bit more bearable, allowing me to amass more hunger and saturation from this unusual diet.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.blazing_quartz.1": "It stands to reason that a place like the nether would have a substance that was flammable, and Blazing Quartz certainly fits the bill. It acts much like coal, even being able to form torches. A useful substance, even if fairly mundane.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.blight.arcane_rite.1": "That echo is why this substance is important for the Unchained Rite. The Rite remembers the violence of its creation, and resonates with the memory within the blight, applying its power to things laying on top of it.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.blight.composition.1": "The Undirected Rite, as the name suggests, is random. It transmutes, but it has no pattern to transmute things to. So, instead, you get something random, bits of disparate matter all jumbled together into a foul-smelling powder. I wouldn't recommend eating it, or growing things on it, but it's otherwise harmless.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.blight.intro.1": "Blight. $iSomething which spoils or damages./$ What the Undirected Rite has created has many strange properties, and I intend to categorize them.\nThe naïve explanation is that it is simply another form of power that taints the world, but that isn't right. Blight isn't harmful, not inof itself. It's just... $igunk./$",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.blight.spread.1": "Blight does not spread on its own. It's just random matter, after all. But it has a spiritual memory, a pattern which to replicate. When given arcana, or a valid fertilizer, blight will haphazardly echo this pattern on the nearby area.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.brilliance.1": "Brilliance is a term I have heard bandied about for what others call experience. It is a part of the soul, though improperly attached, and can be collected and used for enchanting and repairs.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.brilliance.2": "What many don't know is that it can condense into a physical form. I have heard rumors of solid Brilliance coming from crushing ore, but the most reliable source is small clusters of ore where a soul faded away, leaving its experiences engraved on the stone.",

    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.crucible_acceleration.1": "The Spirit Crucible is, unfortunately, a rather slow device. It takes time for it to coalesce the power of the arcana into the central item. This isn't without reason. Most matter simply can't take a faster stream, and you risk damaging the catalyst by overloading it.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.crucible_acceleration.2": "However, by heating the catalyst through mystic means, you can lessen this rejection and speed up the coalescence at once. That is what the Spirit Catalyzer is for. Unfortunately, this is not perfect, and instability often causes the catalyst to be damaged more than strictly necessary.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.crucible_acceleration.3": "Each fueled Catalyzer nearby to a Crucible will amplify the speed of focusing exponentially, up to a maximum of eight. The risk of instability proportionally rises with each one, resulting in your impetus potentially receiving more damage than necessary.",

    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.eldritch_arcana.2": "I am not sure I understand what impulse creates this arcana. I find it in very few beings, and those I find it in are those who already defy explanation. But if it must be the pair to raw arcana, then that would imply that it's the impulse of endings, the $ilast/$ principle of all things.\n\nI do not like that thought.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.elemental_arcana.aerial.1": "Aerial arcana is the simplest of the elemental arcana. That very simplicity that gives it its utility. I have heard tales of magi soaring on the winds, ruling the skies. If any arcana is to make those tales achievable, it is this.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.elemental_arcana.aerial.2": "It is the impulse of speed given form, the desire to run and to soar. It is found in anything particularly swift or mobile.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.elemental_arcana.aqueous.1": "And finally, Aqueous arcana. It is strange, to say the least. It is malleable, yet doesn't do much by itself. It grants an affinity for the sea, but beyond that, its effects are rather esoteric.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.elemental_arcana.aqueous.2": "It is the impulse of change, the desire to adapt. It is found in anything that embodies that adaptation, as well as anything which lives in the flowing waters.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.elemental_arcana.earthen.1": "Earthen arcana is relatively simple as well. It lends itself easily to strength, communion with nature, and the force of vitality. If I wish to enhance myself, or reshape the world, this arcana will be the key.",

    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.elemental_arcana.infernal.1": "Infernal arcana is more complex, but not nearly as malicious as it might seem. Fire is dangerous, yes, but it is also the source of light and heat. It can burn something down as easily as it can fuse two things together.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.elemental_arcana.infernal.2": "It is the impulse of light, the desire to burn. It is found in anything that shines brightly, as well as most denizens of the nether.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.esoteric_reaping.1": "When a being dies, its soul disperses. This is basic theory, and well proven by this point. It's been proposed that sometimes, that power leaks into the body of the creature as it dies, to explain the existence of reagents they drop. That hadn't been proven yet.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.esoteric_reaping.2": "But now, with my scythe, I have proved it beyond doubt. When a soul is shattered, even if only for a brief moment, the energy collides with what's left of it's vessel. This phenomena appears to create a strong reaction, a change of sorts.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.esoteric_reaping.3": "I have discovered four reagents born through this process, which I will detail further in this entry. In summary, the flesh of zombies can curdle to Rotting Essence; the bones of skeletons can crystallize to Grim Talc; the magic of witches can form Alchemical Calx; and the wings of phantoms can spin to Astral Weave.",

    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ether.1": "A common task for an apprentice magus is to create a flame that burns without heat or fuel. It serves as a test of magical control, as well as the ability to circumvent natural phenomena. Spirit arcana, of course, can produce this wonder as well.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ether.2": "A peculiarity of Ether's flame is that it resonates with colors. As if it was leather to be dyed, I can tint its appearance. It is an emitter of light, so dyeing it darker colors will lower the intensity rather than change the color of the flame itself.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ether.iridescent.1": "As if this was not enough, I have found a way to imbue a second color into my Ether, creating Iridescent Ether. When created, this form of Ether locks in its original color, leaving a new, $isecond/$ color open to dyeing. The light will shift from the original color into the new color towards the peak of the flames.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ether.iridescent.2": "Getting the right coloring for this can be tricky, though. As stated, once Ether is made Iridescent, its original color can no longer be changed. This is hardly an issue, but should be kept in mind when tinting your flames.",

    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.etheric_nitrate.vivid_nitrate.1": "Vivid nitrate, which lacks a proper texture as of right now, is a devilish creation. It's a much more potent version of etheric nitrate that also bounces every time it explodes.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.focus_ashes.1": "By applying differing qualities of arcana to an Alchemical Impetus, I can cause powders of various forms to be created. It is a simple yet very useful arcane recipe.",

    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.focus_metals.1": "By altering the composition of the Alchemical Impetus with niter, sulfur, and cthonic gold, it is possible to alter the artifact in such a way that allows for forming nodes of most pure metals.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.focus_metals.2": "It isn't particularly efficient or fast, but it is certainly better than having to mine for every ingot I need. Each metallic node can be processed at a furnace of any kind into two thirds of an ingot worth of metal nuggets.",

    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.introduction.5": "The natures of the soul I condense influence the crystal's properties. Each soul is slightly different, and that can result in changes to the crystals formed. I believe these spirit crystals to be just the breakthrough I need.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.magebane_belt.1": "The Magebane Belt is one of my more devious inventions, and dead simple too. Normally, after being struck by any attack, soul ward will not recover until a long moment after. That moment of downtime has proven itself detrimental far too frequently. But that ends now.",

    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.natural_quartz.1": "Natural Quartz is, as the name implies, a natural equivalent of the nether resource. It's used for most of the same things. It's rare, and found deep underground, sometimes in geodes.",

Not always does this bliss come to me naturally, but that changes now. While worn, this accessory will hide my presence from nearby adversaries, decreasing their likelihood of taking interest in me.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.necklace_of_the_hidden_blade.1": "When the bearer of this necklace is struck, they receive a temporary but incredibly powerful boost to their scythe's damage output. The strength of this effect is exponentially proportional to the amount of damage taken, but lasts for only a single strike.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.necklace_of_the_mystic_mirror.1": "I have devised another way to capture some of the lost energy from loose spirits. The Resonant Lens I socketed in is able to focus magic, collecting a little bit of excess energy as I pick up arcana. This energy is then redistributed to the rest of my trinkets, increasing the effect of any that act upon collecting spirits.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.necklace_of_the_narrow_edge.1": "The sweep of the scythe is its main draw. The ability to cut my targets like so much wheat is invaluable. But that comes at the cost of damage to a single target. This necklace mystically focuses the edge of my attack, directing all of the power into one target for a strong damage boost.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.necklace_of_tidal_affinity.1": "You are faster in water. While under the effect of conduit power, the effect is further improved. You also amass a strong damage reduction and are blessed with constant health regeneration.",

    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.scythes.2": "What I had managed to do before with careful, painstaking experiments, the scythe did in a matter of seconds.

It can intercept attacks from both, creating an effect I call Soul Ward. It takes time to restore if the effect is disrupted, but it acts as additional armor which nearly absorbs magic damage completely, and dampens physical damage.",

    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulwood.sap.1": "The sticky lifeblood of the tree also seems to well up much more often in a tree than in Runewood. The sap's effects are corrupted as well; rather than restoring my vigor, Unholy Syrup enhances it, increasing my attack strength.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_crystals.1": "The soul is a notoriously fickle thing. Even confirming its existence is difficult, requiring the highest thaumaturgies to get a reading.

    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_crystals.2": "A material I have named Soulstone is the means by which we do so. It appears mundane until refined, but once it is rid of impurities, it seems... out of phase with the world. By creating a blade using it as a core, I should be able to strike not only the physical form, but also the soul, shattering it to energy before it can disperse.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_crystals.3": "These energies, as previously noted, have different 'frequencies' of sorts. A being burning with light would have a soul that reflects that radiance, and a being prone to adaptation would have a soul as malleable as itself. Occasionally, the energy has no flavor to it at all, leaving only the raw impulse of creation behind. That type of crystal bears further study.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_fabric.1": "Spirit Fabric is a light yet sturdy material that acts as an insulator for spirit energies. While other materials have the same properties, it's not exactly practical to craft a pouch or clothing from stone. I'm not willing to go quite so far for my research as to try wearing something like $ithat/$.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_fabric.pouch.1": "But this fabric works wonderfully for storing spirit crystals. It keeps the arcana condensed within, and will even store spirits I pick up before they so much as clutter my pockets. It can store as many spirits as a single chest, making it quite convenient to carry around.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_focusing.1": "Using the opposing polarities of Twisted and Tainted Rock, I have created a device that draws in and focuses arcane energy. If given a compatible substrate, I can use this process to create things.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_focusing.2": "The basic substrate here is the Alchemical Impetus, an artifact similar to those I've seen in the past. By focusing arcana into it, I can cause bits of the calx to transmute into something new, though this damages the Impetus in the process.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_infusion.1": "By using Runewood's natural magic as a base, I have designed the altar that will serve as the basis for my magecraft - the Spirit Altar. It is the other piece of the equation, the use for the arcana. By infusing them into items, and using the energies to effect other fusions, I can begin to explore this.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_infusion.2": "To use the altar, I must lay the item I wish to infuse on top of it, along with an appropriate set of arcana. If I wish to fuse other items in the process, I must place them on some form of Runewood item holder. They must be within four blocks of the altar to work.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_infusion.3": "Once all the arcana are present, the power within the crystals will begin to flow into the central item. If other items are fused in, they are pulled in during this process. When all of that is done, the product of the infusion will appear. It $iis/$ rather slow, though...",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_infusion.hex_ash.1": "My first product with this process is a powder I call Hex Ash, after its color. It is a simple and useful grit, with the niter and sulfur mostly transmuted by the raw arcana, leaving a mixture of reagent and carbon.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_metals.hallowed_gold.1": "Gold is often used as a thaumaturgical base, its natural conductivity of magic making it quite useful. Spirit arcana are no exception. In fact, using Sacred arcana, we can enhance those properties.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_metals.hallowed_gold.2": "Hallowed Gold, as a metal, acts much like its mundane counterpart. The inherent innocence of the arcana infused into the alloy makes other arcana glide through it smoothly, creating the perfect conductor for my purposes.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_metals.hallowed_gold.spirit_jar.1": "A simple application of this metal is the Spirit Jar. As spirits in their raw form don't have mass, by trapping them under Hallowed Gold you can store far more than you could physically. The capacity of these jars is near-infinite, though each only stores one type of spirit.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_metals.soulstained_steel.1": "Iron is mundane, in a word. By using Hex Ash as my source of carbon, and attuning the metal with Soulstone, I can create a metal that is $isimultaneously/$ in and out of phase with the world.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_metals.soulstained_steel.2": "Anything made from Soulstained Steel is capable of striking the soul, without the need for specifics of engineering like with my crude scythe. Wearing the metal in its base form as armor is dangerous, as it will touch your own soul as well, so I must engineer a countermeasure.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_stones.tainted_rock.1": "Stone is reluctant to change, but nothing can endure the power of an unchained soul forever. By using raw arcana to force that change, I have created stones with useful magical properties. With Sacred arcana as the catalyst, it forms Tainted Rock, a stone that dissipates magic nearby.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_stones.twisted_rock.1": "With Wicked arcana's nature as the opposite of Sacred, it follows that the stone produced with it would act opposite. Twisted Rock has most of the same properties as Tainted Rock, but pushes magic away from it instead of dissipating it. Both can be fashioned into item holders, as Runewood can.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_trinkets.1": "Many disciplines of magic, and even more mundane practices, allow the creation of useful trinkets. These are also referred to as baubles or curios by some. The metals I have alloyed have properties useful in their own rights, and can be used as the basis for even grander designs.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_trinkets.2": "In their most basic form, Hallowed Gold trinkets protect the user as if they were wearing weak armor, and Soulstained Steel trinkets increase the toughness of the armor being worn.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_trinkets.guardian_ring.1": "As a first attempt to create a trinket using these as a base, I have designed one that mimics Soulstained Armor's Soul Ward.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.totem_magic.1": "Up until now, when performing spirit arcana, I have limited my research to personal enhancement and material production. Now, I affect the world.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.totem_magic.2": "To begin with Totem Magic, I may engrave spirit arcana into Runewood Logs, forming a rune representing the magic. If unwanted, engraved spirits can be stripped off with an axe, but I have uses in mind. With a Runewood Totem Base, and then a specific set of runes in a totem pole placed above my totem base, I can perform a Spirit Rite.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.totem_magic.3": "While each rite does offer a unique function, they follow patterns and categorize easily. For what I term \"aura rites\", they are simple, effect-providing rites that affect anything living within eight blocks of the base. For other rituals which alter beings, most affect anything within half the range of an aura rite.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.totem_magic.4": "For those which alter blocks, most affect the five-by-five area on the level beneath the base, towards where the runes are facing. These rituals can also be made more selective with the use of Item Stands. By placing them on the sides of the rune pillars, you can make the ritual only recognize and alter the types of blocks lying on the stands.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.totem_magic.5": "One caveat is that no rite's totem may function within the range of another, identical ritual. If you try, the first one will simply fizzle out, the energies coursing through it disrupted.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.transmutation.intro.1": "The unchained rite is used to change the nature of the mundane, and upon further study, this doesn't appear to be limited to just Souldwood. After countless hours spent trying to discover all the secrets the Rite holds, I've come to document just three transmutation trees of sorts.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.tyrving.1": "The Tyrving is a rather esoteric blade. It's strange design makes it appear as a weak weapon not suited for combat. However, it's hex ash lining and twisted rock form cause it to deal extra magic damage to the soul, the greater the soul the more benefit.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.tyrving.2": "The weapon can also be repaired using arcane restoration quite efficiently.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.voodoo_magic.1": "The future holds many secrets..",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.wicked_rite.greater": "By twisting the power of malice like a knife, nearby beings on the brink of death are dealt a fatal blow to the body and soul.",
