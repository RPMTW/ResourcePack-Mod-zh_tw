A $(item)Stabilized Conjuring Focus$(), which is reinforced with $(l:conjuring:basics/soul_composite_materials#soul_slice)Soul Slices$(), is exponentially more powerful. Once inserted into a $(l:conjuring:basics/conjurer)Conjurer$(), it will start mimicking a player's presence, practically allowing for perpetual summoning."
