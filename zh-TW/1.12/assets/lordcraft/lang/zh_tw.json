    "lord.water.conv1.text": "Greetings Thelos, I am pleased to meet you. I am Aqua, Overlord of Water. The others here would not trust you, but I have a plan that may change their minds. Do you wish to hear my plan?",
    "lord.water.conv11.text": "I am glad that you wish to appease my siblings. I am sure that they will trust you in time.",
    "lord.water.conv111.text": "Your predecessor wasn't particularly amicable, in fact she was very hostile to us. The others believe that such thoughts might... transfer along with the power of the Thelos. I on the other hand do not believe this. I seek to prove the others wrong!",
    "lord.water.conv112.text": "My plan is to make you my apprentice. You see if you were to take on our customs, the others may then believe that you are not an enemy of ours. Do you accept?",
    "lord.water.conv1121.text": "Good, I shall give you a task to prove yourself. Return here once you are done and I shall reward you with your first spell!",
    "lord.water.convM.text": "Thelos you have returned! What is it you wish to tell me?",
    "lord.water.convM1.text": "This is the elemental Nexus, you stand within the great temple of the Overlords. This place was constructed at the end of the last Lord War, by your ancestor the first Thelos Zaloweist.",
    "lord.water.convM11.text": "Zaloweist was a lord who was born into the old kingdom of fire. You see back then the realms where we now dwell were just like the Overworld where we left you. Each of the kingdoms controlled a landmass when he ended the war he split us apart to keep the peace between us.",
    "lord.water.convM111.text": "During the war he travelled throughout all the lands, learning the ways of the people and the elements under which they lived. his task took many years and even once he had studied all he could from the people of the realm, he meditated for many years still, until eventually he found a way to purify that which he had learned to control raw energy itself. During the last elemental cycle he returned to the world, he faced down the great generals of the opposing factions, striking them both down ending the war once and for all.",
    "lord.water.convM12.text": "Last I saw of Zaloweist... he said he was looking for someone who had gone missing. I can't quite place who it was though, it's... it's almost as though those memories are gone from my mind, but yet I picture them so vividly other than about who it was.",
    "lord.water.convM121.text": "I believe he had tracked this individual to the Void, the area between the universes. Since Zaloweist entered it, we have not seen him, but whispers of his existence still spread. But we know better for the Thelos can only be reborn in another when the last is gone from reality, and as you know... you are a Thelos so...",
    "lord.water.convM2.text": "I am Aqua, Overlord of Water. The Overlords are the most powerful lords in the realms. We govern and protect this universe using our control over the elements. Of course with proper training you will soon be more powerful than us. Then you too may join us here in this temple as the leader.",
    "lord.water.convM3.text": "What do you want to say?",
    "lord.water.convM31.text": "You have not finished your current quest.",
    "lord.water.convM32.text": "Ah great, here are your rewards!",
    "lord.water.convM33.text": "Here is your new assignment.",
    "lord.water.convM34.text": "You don't have a quest.",
    "lord.water.convML1.text": "You have done well and I now name you my apprentice, you are now eligible to learn your first water spell from me. I have given you your spell focus already. With that in hand you shall be able to use your internal energy to heal yourself It can even heal others as an §nAlternate§r §nEffect§r. Use it wisely.",
    "lord.water.convML11.text": "But wait Thelos, there is more!",
    "lord.water.convML12.text": "Indeed there is more, I have a special task for you since you have proven yourself. I would like you to use your spell a number of times, but you must make sure that you only count the times in which it actually has effect, when the target is injured... It should be noted that those of an undead nature may react differently to its powers!",
    "lord.water.convML2.text": "I am pleased that you have continued your training thus far. I have another spell for you to try, it's called Whirlpool. It entraps and confuses targets in a radius of where you are looking.",
    "lord.water.convML21.text": "Good luck Thelos!",
    "lord.water.convML3.text": "Here we are again, ready to learn more. You know what I am going to ask you to do.",
    "lord.water.convML4.text": "You are doing well so far, now I would like you to use your new spell Rainfall, this spell can change the weather. It will even keep it from raining for a long time after you stop it.",
    "lord.water.convML5.text": "You are now advanced enough to use your tier 2 elemental powers, I can teach you the theory for this one but you will have to adapt it for whichever you know.",
    "lord.water.convML51.text": "There... Now you understand it please use this knowledge well, return when you feel ready for more tasks.",
    "lord.water.convML6.text": "You have reached your maximum potential bar this one technique... Good, now that you know that you can unleash your power on the world. If you continue to do quests for me I can give you a larger mana pool as per.",
    "lord.earth.conv1.text": "You have proven yourself Thelos. I will admit, I doubted my sister at first, but you have certainly exceeded all of my expectations.",
    "lord.earth.conv11.text": "Please Thelos, you should not be thanking me. I doubted you, I do not deserve your thanks. You are kind beyond those who came before you.",
    "lord.earth.conv12.text": "As I suspected, full of wisdom.",
    "lord.earth.conv13.text": "I am glad.",
    "lord.earth.conv2.text": "Yes my sister did mention that you might. Alas there is much work to be done, this will not be an easy task for you to undertake. Are you ready to train yourself to be one with the very thing upon which you stand?",
    "lord.earth.conv21.text": "Then we shall begin at once my new apprentice!",
    "lord.earth.convM.text": "Greetings Thelos, it is good to see you again. Was there something that you wanted?",
    "lord.earth.convM1.text": "Go ahead.",
    "lord.earth.convM11.text": "I am Terra Overlord of Earth. I believe in the balance of the worlds, a steady place where change is slight and so well rounded, to plan ahead rather than to rush hastily into things. That is the way of the earth and so it is the way of myself.",
    "lord.earth.convM12.text": "Well I know little of you, but you are not the first Thelos to come here as of late, of course Zaloweist created this place, he did great things in his time. Then there is Luxios, she came here looking to learn, but she discovered something that caused her to turn on us...",
    "lord.earth.convM121.text": "Zaloweist was the greatest lord to have ever lived, master of lightning and the will of the elements. Maybe in time you will surpass him, but be wary for he was brought up in a time of war, oppressed by all he learned the failings of those around him, and through that he obtained the strength to achieve all that he did. This is something that you are unlikely to ever see, perhaps you should be glad to live in such a time of peace as now.",
    "lord.earth.convM122.text": "Luxios was the second Thelos to be revealed to the world. She fell to the corruption of great power, too hasty I say. The others think there may have been more to it but, I know well the hearts of humans. It is this evil that we feared within you, I should have not seen it in you, I was too quick to judge. I have fallen prey to the very thing I seek to avoid, I regret my actions and hope to make amends by training you in the art of earth.",
    "lord.earth.convM123.text": "Did I say there were others? I don't remember I guess I suggested that there might have been more but... I am not quite sure, some force has blocked our vision for many years, we have often found ourselves unable to fully recall certain actions and events. I am not sure if there were others, but yet... It feels as though there were...",
    "lord.earth.convM13.text": "The others are discussing many things that do not concern you as of yet, they may in time, but I should not divulge such secrets until the others say I should. In fact you will probably hear from them rather than me.",
    "lord.earth.convM2.text": "We are the Overlords, the most powerful lords in the realms, we are siblings and we are tasked with keeping order in this place.",
    "lord.earth.convM3.text": "What do you want to say?",
    "lord.earth.convM31.text": "You have not finished your current quest.",
    "lord.earth.convM32.text": "Ah great, here are your rewards!",
    "lord.earth.convM33.text": "Here is your new assignment.",
    "lord.earth.convM34.text": "You don't have a quest.",
    "lord.earth.convML1.text": "You have done well so far, I will alert the others of your progress, they may take interest in having you as an apprentice. It can never be a guarantee with them but time will tell as it always does. I have a special assignment for you now. I want you to try out this spell. I call it Stone Shot, it will fire a stone projectile in the direction you are facing. Use it well Thelos.",
    "lord.earth.convML2.text": "Once again I am most pleased with your work. You have shown much of what it means to be the Thelos! For the work you have done I wish for you to try this new spell of mine. I have tuned the Stone Shot spell for combat. It is more efficient, so much so that you will find yourself able to launch an array of projectiles. I call it Scatter Shot. Please return once you have finished.",
    "lord.earth.convML3.text": "Your progress has been steady, you are close to truly understanding what it means to be a lord of earth. Now I show you a technique that can be a challenge to master but when used correctly can prove to be formidable. it is called Earth-Shaker, the idea here is to assume a strong stance, inhale deeply. Then as you exhale slam your fist with all your might into the ground beneath you. Do this and you will be well on your way.",
    "lord.earth.convML4.text": "This is the last basic technique I can teach. This we call Smash, it breaks terrain around the area you are looking, it has an alternate effect which is for precision digging.",
    "lord.earth.convML5.text": "Well, as I said before the basic spells have run dry and so I must now teach you theory for the advanced set of spells, the idea for the first of these is to feel the world around you, do not act but rather wait, listen it will tell you what the best course is. Then with your will, visualise the results and you shall see the effect.",
    "lord.earth.convML6.text": "I am proud of you my Thelos, you have done so much in such a short time. I have not seen skills like yours in many years. I trust you now Thelos, and your judgement. If you ever need my support here, know that I will be behind you in almost any event. But now it is time for your last lesson. Think back to our last, feel the breath of the world within you, now hold it, let it fill you, then exhale slowly. Open your eyes and observe your power.",
    "lord.air.conv1.text": "Thelos, you have kept me waiting! I am Aer, Overlord of Air and I live as my element does, swift and ever changing. Lords of Air are unbound unlike the others around us.",
    "lord.air.conv11.text": "It was rude of me to sound so... frustrated with you for it was not your fault, it is I who should apologise.",
    "lord.air.conv12.text": "Though you are correct, your tone is not one which I find wholly promising.",
    "lord.air.conv111.text": "I suspected as much, Aqua spoke highly of you and so I trust that you will make a worthy apprentice. We shall begin your training at once!",
    "lord.air.convM.text": "Greetings Thelos, it is good to see you again. Was there something that you wanted?",
    "lord.air.convM1.text": "Go ahead.",
    "lord.air.convM11.text": "I am Aer, Overlord of Air which means that I like my siblings are the most skilled of our class within the realms.",
    "lord.air.convM111.text": "Yes, realms... each of us governs a dimension that is heavily influenced by our elements. Though they share similarities they differ greatly.",
    "lord.air.convM1111.text": "That's not for me to say, only Lux would be able to give you entry since she knew the old Thelos the best she would be able to sense the evil within you, better than any of us.",
    "lord.air.convM12.text": "I know that you are capable and I know that you are the Thelos... That's about it really.",
    "lord.air.convM13.text": "You noticed that... impressive. We aren't actually siblings. You see after the Lord Wars of old the Thelos Zaloweist decided that the best way to keep the peace would not be to put war grizzled veterans in charge of their respective groups but rather a wholly new group of individuals, and so he created us. We are designed to best represent our given element, so as not to frustrate the members of each nation.",
    "lord.air.convM2.text": "Well you see it is connected to each of our realms, the platforms outside allow us to travel from here to there. Though you will not be able to enter until Lux trusts you, we cannot risk the safety of our peoples.",
    "lord.air.convM3.text": "What do you want to say?",
    "lord.air.convM31.text": "You have not finished your current quest.",
    "lord.air.convM32.text": "Ah great, here are your rewards!",
    "lord.air.convM33.text": "Here is your new assignment.",
    "lord.air.convM34.text": "You don't have a quest.",
    "lord.air.convML1.text": "I am glad that you are doing well. It has been a long while since I have had the pleasure of training one with such talent as a mage. Now to teach you your first spell. By focusing your mind and feeling the air currents around you, you should find yourself able to shift them, forcing them to drive your foes into the air.",
    "lord.air.convML2.text": "You are impressing me more and more, Thelos. It is good to see you eager to learn more! Now I shall teach you another spell, before I told you to force the air to lift your foes, but now I want you to give it time to build up then, once you feel you have held it enough release it in a cutting motion.",
    "lord.air.convML3.text": "You again fail to disappoint me. Now to teach you the signature Overlord technique but this time for air. This is much like the others, just focus your mind and you will find the element come to your call.",
    "lord.air.convML4.text": "This next lesson will involve building a trust between you and the air itself, no longer are you just commanding, now you are part of it. Only with this in mind will you be able to perform flight, borne aloft by the trust you form.",
    "lord.air.convML5.text": "Now my training will have to be more generalised, since this technique can apply in two ways. Before we lifted our foes with the air, but I feel we can focus this better, to either disperse them, or have you ride the wind towards your goal.",
    "lord.air.convML6.text": "This is the last technique I can show you. The power to lift entities is at your fingertips whether it be yourself or others that will be up to you to decide. Focus the wind, feel it twist in your hands, and direct its destiny!",
    "lord.fire.conv1.text": "Greeting Thelos my name is Ignis Overlord of Fire, your efforts so far in gaining the trust of my siblings have impressed me. You are now worthy of learning how to control Fire like a true Lord, however my teachings will require some... payment, I have some tasks for you.",
    "lord.fire.conv11.text": "Well, I am sure you have already visited my dimension, once known as the realm of fire, now know by another name... The Nether. There is a great corruption hanging over it, I would ask that you help me purge it.",
    "lord.fire.conv12.text": "I had hoped that we may both be able to benefit from our arrangement, if you help me I teach you, that is the deal. If you do not wish to learn then so be it, but I must insist that you help.",
    "lord.fire.conv111.text": "Thank you Thelos, your first task will be to craft a Soul Crystal (Ignis) using a Searing Crystal and a Void Catalyst in a Void Workbench. The crystal will be able to absorb the souls of different mobs from The Nether, by hitting them with it. Bring the crystal back to me once it is full so that I may determine the source of this corruption.",
    "lord.fire.conv112.text": "A pity. I will await your return should you change your mind.",
    "lord.fire.convM.text": "Welcome back Thelos I am glad to see you return safe.",
    "lord.fire.convM1.text": "What did you wish to ask?",
    "lord.fire.convM11.text": "The Nether is the twisted remains of my dimension, with your assistance I hope that I will be able to return it to it's former glory. Each of us rules over a dimension, one day you may be able to visit the others, but not without the other's permission.",
    "lord.fire.convM12.text": "Here we mostly gather to discuss the future of our peoples, otherwise we sit in meditation pondering ways in which we may further our connection to our element so as to strengthen our power.",
    "lord.fire.convM13.text": "Ah, a curious thing indeed! Only the Thelos and Overlords have been granted such a gift. You enter your Primal State by merging your own spirit with that of an Elemental being for a given element, together you are capable of many feats that would simply be impossible otherwise.",
    "lord.fire.convM2.text": "Well, we are each named after our given Element, does that not seem reasonable to you? Aqua the Overlord of Water, Terra the Overlord of Earth, Aer the Overlord of Air, Ignis the Overlord of Fire, Lux the Overlord of Light and Arackzhal the Overlord of Darkness.",
    "lord.fire.convM22.text": "I... uh... I suppose that would be correct, I know there is a good reason why he isn't but I can't quite place my finger on it. I could have sworn there was a Tenebrae before, but I am not certain. I shall think on this and inform you of it should I remember why!",
    "lord.fire.convM3.text": "What do wish to say?",
    "lord.fire.convM31.text": "You have not finished your current quest.",
    "lord.fire.convM32.text": "Ah great, here are your rewards!",
    "lord.fire.convM33.text": "Here is your new assignment.",
    "lord.fire.convM34.text": "You don't have a quest.",
    "lord.fire.convMQ1.text": "I wanted to thank you properly for your efforts in filling this soul crystal Thelos, although I have not yet determined exactly what these results mean, I have determined that I may be able to re-acquire a foothold in The Nether again. I need you to construct a Lordic Anchor by combining a Block of Searing Crystal with a Void Catalyst, then go to The Nether place it and Activate it. By doing so you will create a link between this dimension and The Nether.",
    "lord.fire.convMQ2.text": "With the link established to The Nether, the information you provided as a result of you attempting it and that which I have collected from this crystal, it is now clear as to the source of this corruption. The Wither must be summoned into reality and then destroyed, only then will I be able to begin pushing this corruption from my realm. You must defeat the Wither!",
    "lord.fire.convMQ3.text": "I have been researching into this figure you spoke of, although I am no close to working out who they are, I have made a discovery into the Void. I have dreamed of powerful tools constructed from the very Void itself, let me show you what I have imagined. I need you attempt to construct some Stabilized Void Matter and bring it to me. Just to prove that I am not mad.",
    "lord.fire.convML1.text": "You have done well Thelos in completing your first task, and so it is that I shall teach you your first fire spell, Ignite. Simply point at a location and observe as it bursts into flames. It shall take me some time to decipher the information you have brought me, so why don't you test that out for a little while and then return here.",
    "lord.fire.convML2.text": "This is most troubling, you say that upon the activation of my anchor a strange figure appeared above it, then upon meeting your gaze vanished to reveal two skeletal warriors... I will continue to look into this, but for your effort I shall reward you with a new spell, Fireball. While I determine what has happened try it out for a bit.",
    "lord.fire.convML3.text": "With the Wither gone I should be able to begin purging this evil from my realm. I cannot thank you enough, I shall you teach you another spell, Orb of Fire. I am sure I will find more work for you soon, but for now try out that new technique.",
    "lord.fire.convML4.text": "I am so glad to know that I am not mad. You have done more than I could have imagined for me so far.

You will earn this type of mana from the Overlords each time you level up with one of them, this mana is shared between all elements and refills over time. §nVoid Crystals§r can be used to hold a portion of this mana by §nRight-Clicking§r with them.
