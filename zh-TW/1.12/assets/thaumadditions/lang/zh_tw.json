    "research_stage.thaumadditions:essence_salt.2": "Well, that was a waste of time. Even though I've studied them forever, it was still shocking how fragile they seem, broken pieces practically evaporating in my hands. I can only assume that the lone shards lost stability to the larger chunks of crystal as I ground it... <BR>Hm... perhaps crushing it all at once, evenly, will keep the shards equally stable? My own weight from an average height should do the trick - though, it may be best to test with multiple at once, considering the chance of it failing.",

    "research_stage.thaumadditions:mithrillium.2": "I'm... surprised, actually. The Void's whispers still continue to mention empowering their metal, despite having done just that? Perhaps I've accidentally cured the metal of some of its corruption..? <BR>A strange metal with a blue sheen, it has the strange contradictive properties of the Void Metal, but without its cursed impurities. The only thing that slipped through past the Void's cries for power was a strange sound, similar to Myth. I suppose its as good a name as any: §lMithrillium§r.

Despite the powers of Adaminite, with its red hue now coming to remind me of Ichor, God's blood, is truly amazing... but had to trade some of its material strength for magical. Perhaps if I infused more Mithrillium into it, it could regain some of its lost strength... I've drawn up a diagram for this, a much more simple ritual than the last one.",
    "research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite.2": "Further, further, this material's power grows. The quicksilver worked perfectly, drawing the hardness of the Mithrillium back into the Adaminite.

    "research_stage.thaumadditions:adaminite.2": "Yet again to my surprise, this damned experiment was in fact successful! Minus a few small fires, of course. <BR>This strong, blood-red material, which I've dubbed §lAdaminite§r simply because it was the first unused word to come to mind, is more magically inclined than its parent metal, and should be of further use despite its expenses.",

    "research_stage.thaumadditions:mithrillium_smelter.2": "This is much purer, indeed. In fact, I don't think I've logged any sort of loss - the essentia slurry it creates can't even be regarded as a slurry any more, as if it's been pre-separated by the metal. It's truly the perfect reaction, with near-0% loss.",

    "research_stage.thaumadditions:adaminite_smelter.2": "Amazing. By filtering some of the raw essentia through an Adaminite casing, nearby matching essentia from the aura seemed to pass through and condense inside.

    "research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_smelter.2": "This expense doesn't quite feel worth it, honestly. I suppose the new Mithminite smeltery is faster and has a higher extra output (+50%), but the insane cost makes it of questionable use unless I can spare the materials. I suppose if the time comes, it will be here.",

    "research_stage.thaumadditions:brass_jar.2": "Take that, you old fools! Long gone are the days of wood! By strengthening the glass with some extra vis infusions and replacing the outdated wooden cap with a polished brass lid, I've managed to better secure the jar. It only stores 25 more essentia, bringing the total to 275, but as a proof-of-concept, it definitely shows that I can improve upon the outdated essentia storage.",
    "research_name.thaumadditions:thaumium_jar": "神秘源質罐子",
    "research_stage.thaumadditions:thaumium_jar.1": "Again, my material studies have given me new potential to improve upon my equipment. The magical nature of Thaumium has seen much use in other places, but its yet to be tested how well it stores raw essentia.",
    "research_stage.thaumadditions:thaumium_jar.2": "By again reinforcing the warding aura of the jar's glass and fastening a specially-made Thaumium lid, I've observed a nice improvement to the original jars. The magical properties of the metal seem to sponge up some of the essentia, acting as an extra storage chamber in a way. Overall, this should see an increase of roughly one hundred from the original jar, a total of 350 essentia.",
    "research_name.thaumadditions:eldritch_jar": "Void Reinforced Jars",
    "research_stage.thaumadditions:eldritch_jar.1": "If I were to say that the Void's whispers were the only thing influencing me writing this, I'd be lying. It's become a genuine curiosity to see how different materials react with raw essentia, and despite all the evil surrounding this blackened ingot, I don't see too much harm in a few tests... ",
    "research_stage.thaumadditions:eldritch_jar.2": "After a few straining tests to make sure the Void Metal didn't damage the glass seal of the jar, I've managed to finally draft a lid to top the new jar. The initial tests actually came to little surprise: the jet-black metal seems to sponge up the raw essentia in a way akin to Thaumium, except in a greater quantity. Adding it to the new strengthened glass warding, it should store an estimated §n500 essentia§r.<BR>Regardless of my success here though, it's best I keep an eye on this. The Void's desires are beyond me - I feel its stare every time I glance at that blackened lid. Plus, the material cost of these upgrades is getting quite extreme...",

    "research_stage.thaumadditions:mithrillium_jar.1": "With the creation of Mithrillium, I've again come back to my old sketches of jars and the efforts I went to in shaping their lids. I'm surprised this hadn't come to me before: why not simply melt the newer metal over the old lid? Its worth testing, and with the malleability of this new blue friend of mine, there's no better place to start.",
    "research_stage.thaumadditions:mithrillium_jar.2": "So. The \"melting new metal over the old one\" ended with lots of charred hairs. After another attempt - making sure the lid wasn't ON the jar this time - I've managed to basically encase the old Void lid in Mithrillium, also taking it upon myself to reshape the jar's glass. With the blue metal's enhanced properties and purer essence, not only have I silenced that scary black gaze from the Void but I've also doubled the essentia storage: with both metals' pressures pushing the essentia into a denser form, the jar now fits §n1000 essentia§r!",

    "research_stage.thaumadditions:adaminite_jar.1": "As lovely as the Mithrillium is, I'm still always open to improvement. While the cobalt-blue metal is a strong material physically, Adaminite has proven to be strong magically. While it's insanely expensive, a few initial tests couldn't hurt...",
    "research_stage.thaumadditions:adaminite_jar.2": "Using a similar method as the previous upgrade, I've molded the Adaminite over the old lids and adjusted the glass again. At this point it feels more like a barrel, both in circumference and storage. The Adaminite condenses all the essentia that passes through it, doubling every bit of the storage previously in the jar. While §n2000 essentia§r is a lot, the jar is quite expensive... also, I've yet to properly test how the condensation of essentia properly works.",

The condensation of most aspects is fine, but condensing §oVitium§r down that much on even a testing scale has had disastrous results.

The method of creation for Mithminite should be a sure enough sign that the old \"melt some metal over the last cap\" trick won't work for this...",
    "research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_jar.2": "Using a somewhat replicable infusion, I've managed to create a prototype† Mithminite Jar. By infusing an old Void Jar with some Mithminite, alumentum to fuse the metals, and amber to strengthen the glass, I've created an improved jar which condenses and sponges up essentia to a capacity of §n4000 essentia§r, twice as much as the last! Not only that, but any excess past its capacity seems to... vanish. I've yet to observe quite how, but I can only assume that by infusing the original Void lid, the dark forces beyond my understanding sap off anything that I have in excess. While this does serve as a good storage and disposal solution, I'd best not pump anything of importance to me in there.<BR><BR>†I'm surprised I never got around to writing this earlier: whenever I do all these tests, I have my own minimally-effective prototypes assembled, and use some math and predictions to estimate the final result.

The fact it's possible has given me renewed optimism, and I've drafted a design for an Alchemical Aspect Combiner to better utilize Mithrillium to condense aspects together. It shouldn't be too dangerous, as long as I keep my fingers out of the mechanisms.<LINE>This one is a fairly simple machine: input the two components to either side, and the output will come out the top.
