Most of an Allosaurus

It's an animate fossil skeleton of an allosaur (originally identified as Allosaurus Fragilis).
However, an incomplete scientific article found in the personal effects of paleontologist
indicates that this classification may have been erroneous.
It consists of 153 disarticulated bones, and 14 plaster-and-fiberglass replacements, held together and animated by an
unknown force.
 Study of this force is hindered by SCP-250's aggressive behavior, which has been assessed by Foundation
 palaeozoologists as being well within theoretical norms for an allosaurus.
SCP-250 emulates what are presumed to have been the standard daily activities of a living allosaurus:
 it wanders its enclosure by day, enters a state of dormancy by night, and will attempt to kill and devour anything
 which it perceives as suitable prey, including humans.
