Shyguy

 He is normally an extremely docile creature, usually sitting or wandering.
However, when someone looks at his face, he will enter a stage of considerable emotional distress.
SCP-096 will cover its face with its hands and begin screaming incoherently.
Approximately after 30 seconds after the first viewing, SCP-096 will begin running to
anyone who viewed its face, and attack.
He can't drown.
He is able to break blocks in order to reach his target. This feature can be changed in the mod settings.
