Builder Bear

It's a small teddy bear, approximately 33 cm in height. Through testing, composition of the subject revealed
no unusual qualities that make it discernible from a non-sapient teddy bear. Subject is capable of moving on its own
accord.
It is hypothesized that the subject is able to construct crude replicas of itself using various materials,
 by a process that has yet to be observed directly by Foundation staff. Currently it can construct two kinds or
 replicas:
 1048-A (made of ears) and 1048-C (made of rusted metal scrap). It will start making them after 20 minutes since
  spawning or if attacked.
 In order to make 1048-A instances, it collects ears from players and animals; 9 ears are required to make one instance.
 To make 1048-C instances, it collects iron ingots from chests and other containers; 9 ingots are required to make one
  instance.
 Both types of replicas are hostile to humans; 1048-A attacks by emitting scream which deals continuous damage to all humans
 in 10 block radius; 1048-C has a melee attack, but additionally can leap at target. When there are no humans around, all
 instances follow the original builder bear.
