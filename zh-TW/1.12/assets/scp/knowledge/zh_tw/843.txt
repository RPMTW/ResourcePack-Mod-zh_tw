Cow Seeds

These seeds produce a plant identical to lima bean. When fully grown, it will create an SCP-843-2 calf,
which is a creature similar to Holstein cattle, but consists of unknown plant material.
The calf is harmless and unable to move. But upon growing into adult, it will gain ability to move and behave
 like normal cow, except it'll become hostile to humans.
