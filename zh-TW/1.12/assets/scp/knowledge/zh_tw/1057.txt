 Absence of Shark

  It's an animate empty space, five (5) meters long, in the shape of an adult tiger shark.
 It does not appear to have any mass; however, it displaces water by an unknown mechanism.
 SCP-1057's refractive index is approximately that of air, which makes it partially visible when immersed in salt water.
 It is hostile to any creature except its kind.
