Contagious Crystal

It's a block which spreads by replacing adjacent blocks. Only the granite is immune to conversion.
All living entities that walk on 409 will receive damage, and will turn into crystal statues on death;
 these statues are invulnerable to any damage, although they explodes after 20 minutes.
