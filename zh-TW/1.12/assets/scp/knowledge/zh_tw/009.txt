Red ice

this block spreads in water by replacing it (every 10 minutes to random direction). Creatures who walk on it
will receive damage; if a creature dies from red ice, its corpse will be replaced by red ice blocks as well.
No creatures can spawn on it.
It can be harvested by a shovel.
A player will also receive damage if he clicks on it, unless holding a sword or a tool.
