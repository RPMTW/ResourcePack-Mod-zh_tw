殭屍瘟疫-一種致命的傳染病。 它可以影響除了SCP以外大多數有生命的生物
Samples of 008 can be acquired from its chamber by using empty syringe on the block with the plague.
Then it can be injected into most living mobs and players (unless they wear a Hazard suit).
008 has 4 stages.
Upon infection, the victim will instantly gain increase in armor, damage and health. Creatures without an attack
will gain one. This is stage 1.
On stage 2, victims will become aggressive to humans if they aren't already;
	players will gain weakness, mining fatigue and slowness; victims will look greenish.
On stage 3, players negative effects will worsen.
On stage 4, 008 will start killing its host. If the host is a player, he will turn into a Plague Zombie on death.

The victims are infectious on any stage of the plague, and will spread it on physical contact.
