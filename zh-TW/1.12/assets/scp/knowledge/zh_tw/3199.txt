Humans, Refuted

A dangerous hostile entity which has long target detection range and tens of health. It has an unusual reproduction
method - it lays an egg every 20 minutes in any open area; eggs turn into hatchlings after a minute; a hatchling becomes
adult after one hour. SCP-3199 will NOT lay an egg if there is no clear space at its feet, or if the amount of eggs
in a nearby area is bigger than 20, or if the count of its instances nearby is bigger than 20, or if the total amount of
 loaded entities is greater than 300. An adult will lay an egg also on death.
 These species can cause world end/corruption scenario if left unattended in a spacious area.
 The egg-related timings can be changed in the config.
