Blizzard's Claws

It is a small snow storm which spawns entities designated as SCP-059-FR-1. These entities hunt mobs that are taller
than 1 block - they will stalk their target for some time, then attack. Their damage bypasses armor, and they have
resistance to sword damage. They will NOT attack entities that are in a group of at least 4 of the same class.
The blizzard spawns these mobs in its area every 30 seconds, up to 8 instances. Blizzard's width can be increased up
 to 100 blocks in the config.
