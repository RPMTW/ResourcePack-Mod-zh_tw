Eyepod

It is a friendly creature which resembles a teardrop.
Its body can have either burnt orange or mustard yellow color.
It usually wanders around, and can climb.
It can be tamed by right-clicking with empty hand. Like wolves, it can be instructed to stay.
A notable feature of Eyepod is that it blocks movement of SCP-173 in its sight.
