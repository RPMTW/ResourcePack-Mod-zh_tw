The Clockworks is a large device weighing several tons and covering an area of eighteen square meters,
 consisting of screw drives, belts, pulleys, gears, springs and other clockwork. It has an ability to convert items into
 different ones depending on the setting set in the control panel ("Rough", "Coarse", "One to one", "Fine", "Very fine").
 Usage: the input item goes to the left hole of Clockworks; operation mode can be changed in the Panel block in the
  middle; pressing "Activate" will start the process if there is a matching clockworks recipe, otherwise the input will
  be ejected back from the hole; when process is finished, output item will be ejected from the right hole.
 Clockworks is also able to repair damaged items.
 You can find out all recipes by enabling appropriate option in the mod settings. Also you can disable original recipes,
 and add custom ones. Adding recipes is done in the file "SCP-914 recipes.cfg", where the recipe format is described
 briefly.
