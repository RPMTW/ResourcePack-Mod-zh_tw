The 'Telekill' Alloy

Can be used for making good tools, sword, armor and better batteries.
It can be smelted from Telekill Ore generated in the world.
Wearing telekill armor gives protection from mind-affecting SCPs (Painting, Eyeball, Bloodstone); protection is proportional to
its cumulative armor value.
There are side-effects from wearing this armor for a long time: the player will start experience dizziness, which worsens with time;
when the severity of side-effects reaches a half of their maximum level, a player will start being unable to "speak" (send chat messages);
when severity is at maximum level, the player becomes completely mute.
Apart from killing oneself, there is no way to get rid of these side-effects quickly - they will start to ease when the player stops
wearing all telekill armor, and it will take a while until the side-effects disappear completely.
