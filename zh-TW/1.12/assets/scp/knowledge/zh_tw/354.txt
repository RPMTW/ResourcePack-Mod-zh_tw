The Red Pool

It is a pool of red liquid. The liquid is of a consistency similar to that of human blood, but is not of a
 biological nature.
Periodically, entities emerge from the pool. Thus far, nearly all creatures emerging from SCP-354 have been extremely
hostile and highly dangerous. Currently it can spawn entities 354-1, -3, -4, -14, -15, -16, -18.
The liquid can multiply the same way as water.
The mechanics of Red Pool are following:
- for the pool to be able to spawn anything, it must consist of at least 64 connected red liquid blocks;
- the pool with select a single block from which the creatures will spawn - it must have red liquid blocks on 4
 adjacent sides;
- when the spawn position is determined, it will attempt to spawn random 354-X mob every 10 minutes;
- it will check an area in 160 blocks range around for presence of 354-X creature and will spawn one if there isn't
 an identical instance already;
