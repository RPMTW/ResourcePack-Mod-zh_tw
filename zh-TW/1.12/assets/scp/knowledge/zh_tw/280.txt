Eyes in the Dark

It's a black human-shaped mass.
No feet or legs are visible, as the lower portion of the body appears to fade away several centimeters from the ground.
It is hostile to humans; avoids light, although light doesn't harm it. If this entity can't find a path to a dark place,
it will try to teleport there.
