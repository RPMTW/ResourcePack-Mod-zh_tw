The Sculpture

It's a sculpture constructed from concrete. It is animate and extremely hostile.
The object cannot move while within a direct line of sight of a human or SCP-131.
Otherwise it will try to kill any nearby human, by snapping the neck at the base of the skull or by strangulation.
It can be damaged by a diamond-level pickaxe.
