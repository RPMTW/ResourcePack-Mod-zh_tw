Document crafter is a valuable block which is used for getting documents of SCPs. How to use: crafter's UI will have
available SCPs shown on the right side, you can scroll their names with the mouse wheel. To get an SCP, type its full name
(case doesn't matter) or number in the textfield. It will show small preview if available and price on the left. Place
enough paper scraps into the 6 slots and press the button; a document will appear. Use this document to place a
containment chamber of the SCP in the world (see related article).
Labels are decorative items which, when placed in the world, will show SCP number, class and small image of the SCP.
They can be traded for 16 paper each.
