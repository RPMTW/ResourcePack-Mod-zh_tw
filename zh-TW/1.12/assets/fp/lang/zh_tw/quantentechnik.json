	"Apparently, many of my previous calculations do not quite agree with each other. I am observing increasingly strange phenomena. The clock of my spaceship showed an incorrect time after my flight. Apparently, there is also a limiting speed I simply cannot exceed. In addition, light apparently responds differently when I observe it.",
	"After very lengthy research, however, I have worked out a model that for the most part explains these effects. To start, there are certain relations between speed, mass, and time. Despite this, there are certain quantum objects which can not be fully understood, and of which I can never determine all their properties at the same time. This effect is especially noticeable in light and elementary particles.",
	"These findings provide countless opportunities for new research. However, sadly enough, they also show me boundaries and limitations, essentially meaning that I will never be able to fly fast enough to ever reach faraway stars in my lifetime.",
	"I should try to deepen my knowledge in all subject areas to try and find useful applications for this knowledge.",
	"Note: New research is available in \"Production\"!",
