  "Space is nothing but a vaccum. To protect myself out there, I have developed an airlock.",
  "It is a rotatable and retractable block, in the retracted state it takes up 1x1x1, while in the extended state it becomes 1x2.5x1 blocks.",
  "With the help of redstone, I can switch between the two states. It is optimally designed for two locks to be placed 3 blocks apart, and due to the rotational properties, you can build both horizontally and vertically.",
