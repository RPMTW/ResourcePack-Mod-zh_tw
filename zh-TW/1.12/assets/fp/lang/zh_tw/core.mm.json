	"I have succeeded in replacing the silicon in the processor housing. After numerous experiments, I was able to develop a quantum processor. It is based on Quantanium elements that can be configured for many functions.",
	"The individual information units can be interlinked in such a way that one's changes influence other units. This allows the processor to apply complex operations to arbitrarily large amounts of data, whereby the result can be seen nearly immediately. The performance limits of the processors are generated mainly by reconfiguring the operation settings.",
	"Inputs and outputs are communicated to and from the system via light, and glowtite is particularly suitable for this. The individual arithmetic units are limited by optical-friendly elements, which I can best make from diamonds.",
