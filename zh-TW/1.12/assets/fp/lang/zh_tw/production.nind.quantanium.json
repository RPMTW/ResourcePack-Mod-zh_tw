  "I have managed to create a material that has effects similar to the tiny quantum objects I have previously seen. It is subject to permanent changes, and yet constantly changes its own properties.",
  "The material itself in reality is only a shell that entraps quantum objects, rendering them more controllable. Those quantum objects are capable of absorbing extremely large amounts of energy and even data, which seems to be at least in part responsible for the strange behavior.",
