	"I've discovered the reason for the dead areas, which are small prism-like structures found on both the surface and in the rock. A close analysis shows that they may have been formed from a form of neon crystals that are oversaturated with organic energy. As these crystals change, they begin to dissolve oranic compounds without direct contact. Despite their aggressiveness, the Prismid only proliferates in these already dead areas. Without proper protection, these structures pose a great danger to me.",
	"Unfortunately, they are unstable and give away most of their energy at will. They are structurally very different from the neon crystals, so I can not use them like the other subspecies."
