	"There's an immense number of stars and planets out there, but almost all are out of my reach. Even with my best ship, it would take many years to get to the next star. But quantum technology offers the potential to bypass certain laws of physics.",
	"If I can realize a corresponding drive, I could reach every star in the shortest possible time."
