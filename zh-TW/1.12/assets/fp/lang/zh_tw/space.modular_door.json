  "I have developed a more flexible version of the airlock, with this gate being freely selectable in size, shape, and orientation.",
  "The modules can be simply placed as a block and can be placed in various orientations (use §lShift + Right Click§r to avoid activating the door). Different orientations can be combined to make a gate.",
  "The idea is to count all blocks that have contact with each other as a door. With a §lRight Click§r on any block of the gate, it can be opened/closed.",
