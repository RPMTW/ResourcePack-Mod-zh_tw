When using it I felt like I was somehow connected to it. After a while I discovered that it was in fact connected to my &4Blood&0 stream. By forcing a large amount of &4Blood&0 through it using the &1Blood Infuser&0, I've managed to create an item that is both connected to my &4Blood&0 stream and can be used as a simple container, allowing me to place it in my favorite machines and using it with my items.",
