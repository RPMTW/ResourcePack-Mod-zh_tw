On average, Apatosaurus grew to about 22.8 meters long and weighed around 16-25 tons. They are mostly docile animals and peacefully graze together from small pairs to large herds (about 2 - 15 individuals), normally led by an elderly alpha female (\"matriarch\"). ",
    "info.baryonyx.name": "Native to Europe and Africa, Baryonyx was a spinosaurid theropod dinosaur that lived during the Early Cretaceous period, (130-125 million years ago). They are thought to have hunted mostly fish and other aquatic prey. It is surprisingly mild-mannered for a carnivore, however, because of its size, the Baryonyx may sometimes consider humans or small dinosaurs prey when hungry.",
    "info.beelzebufo.name": "Also known as the devil frog, the devil toad, or the frog from hell, Beelzebufo was a species of common horned frog (or \"Pac-Man\" frog). It inhabited Madagascar during the Late Cretaceous period(70 million years ago). Due to its size and monstrous, horned head, this frog is named after Beelzebub, a Biblical demon closely associated or synonymous with Satan. ",
    "info.alvarezsaurus.name": "Alvarezsaurus was a reasonably small (2 meters long) theropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period(86 - 83 million years ago). It is native to modern day Argentina. Alvarezsaurus, cutely nicknamed the \"Alvy\" or \"Alvie\", is not dangerous to humans. This inquisitive crepuscular creature mainly hunts insects and sometimes would eat small mammals or lizards. ",
    "info.ammonite.name": "The Perisphinctes Ammonite is an extinct cephalopod subclass that lived throughout the Paleozoic and Mesozoic (Early Devonian - end of the Late Cretaceous). Perhaps some of the most famous extinct animals, the Persphinctes are known for their spiral shells. The shells appear similar to nautilus shells from a distance, but can be identified by indentations, bumps, or even \"spikes\" on the sutures that divide the chambers of their shells.",
    "info.ankylosaurus.name": "Ankylosaurus was a large ankylosaurid from the late Cretaceous period in North America. It is commonly referred to as a “living tank” due to its enhanced methods of defence. These animals are prone to high levels of aggression due to their minimal brain size and weak vision. This creature is to be taken seriously when encountered and should be treated with delicate care. ",
    "info.allosaurus.name": "One of the largest land-living predators of the Late Jurassic period (around 155 - 150 million years ago) the Allosaurus was a large, carnivorous theropod dinosaur. Its remains have been found in the United States, Portugal and regions of Africa. Allosaurus might also have hunted in groups on occasion to bring down really large prey such as sauropods.   ",
    "info.alligator_gar.name": "One of the largest freshwater fish in North America, the Alligator Gar is found in the southern United States and northern Mexico. These fish can grow up to 3 meters long, and they are found in fresh to brackish lakes, rivers, swamps, estuaries and bays in a temperate to subtropical climate.The gar itself is a stalking ambush predator that eats mostly smaller fish, though they have also been known to eat small mammals from the water's surface.",
    "info.achillobator.name": "The Achillobator, or the “Achilles warrior”, was one of the largest known dromaeosaurids, measuring around 5 meters long when fully grown. These dinosaurs lived in Mongolia, around 93 - 80 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous period. Because of its bones, experts believe that the Achillobator was either a new type of dinosaur or a “chimera” mistakenly reconstructed from two different dinosaurs.",
    "info.mamenchisaurus.name": "Native to China during the Late Jurassic Period(160-145 million years ago), Mamenchisaurus had a neck that made up about half its body. Most species of Mamenchisaurus had a body length of about 15-25 meters, but one species, M. sinocanadorum, is thought to have been able to reach lengths of up to 35 meters, making it one of the longest sauropods.

    "info.dreadnoughtus.name": "Native to Argentina in the Late Cretaceous period, the Dreadnoughtus was a towering giant that dwarfed most other sauropods in sheer scale. Like most of Titanosauria, it’s hide was studded with small, boney osteoderms that protected the weaker juveniles from predators. They would have lived in loose herds of 3-4 members, but usually regrouped in large numbers during mating season.",
    "info.sinoceratops.name": "Sinoceratops was a large ceratopsian that lived in East Asia during the Late Cretaceous. Their diet was mainly made up of tough plant matter such as ferns and cycads. Unlike their larger cousin triceratops, Sinoceratops only had a single nose horn but made up for this in a much more elaborate frill. They mainly lived in smaller family groups than other ceratopsians of 4-10 individuals led by a breeding pair.",
    "info.spinoraptor.name": "Spinoraptor is a hereditarily altered type of dinosaur, made by Dr. Henry Wu by consolidating the base genome of Spinosaurus with that of Velociraptor. The Spinoraptor is a social creature and needs somewhere in the range of two and four individuals from their species to stay content.",
    "info.diplodocus.name": "Native to North America during the Late Jurassic (about 154-150 million years ago), Diplodocus could grow up to about 35 meters in length, and an estimated 10-16 tons in weight. Although not the biggest known sauropod, it is still the longest dinosaur of which a complete skeleton has been found. Due to their massive size, fully grown, healthy Diplodocus most likely didn't need to worry too much about predators.",
    "info.ankylodocus.name": "Ankylodocus is a hereditarily changed types of dinosaur, made by Dr. Henry Wu by consolidating the base genome of Diplodocus with that of Ankylosaurus. Ankylodocus has the long, level figure of the sauropod Diplodocus, and the forcing, cautious highlights of the Ankylosaurus, for example, sharp spikes covering its back and a clubbed tail.",
    "info.camarasaurus.name": "One of the most common sauropods, Camarasaurus lived in North America during the Late Jurassic. It had very strong teeth, and little evidence of gastroliths (gizzard stones), implying that it may have processed its food to some degree before swallowing it. Its diet would mostly have consisted of tough, fibrous plants.",
