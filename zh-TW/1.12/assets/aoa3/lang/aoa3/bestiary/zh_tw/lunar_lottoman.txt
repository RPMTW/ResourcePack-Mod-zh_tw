A lottoman from Lunalus. Strangely, despite all other lottomen preferring to isolate themselves in remote locations; lunar lottomen reside in lunar villages with the Zal. They don't appear to interact in any way however, and the Zal appear almost unwilling to even broach the topic.

Like all lottomen, the lunar lottoman is only interested in the topic of trade.
