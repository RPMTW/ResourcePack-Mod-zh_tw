Resembling a two-headed blue walrus, the Angler roams the L'Borean coral fields aimlessly.
In a strange feat of evolution, it appears to have a bioluminescent growth protruding from above each of its heads. It's presumed that these growths were originally intended to lure potential prey when it lived underwater.
With it now being primarily a land animal however, its head growths don't have any known function.

Like most other two-headed, multi-tusked creatures, Anglers are aggressive and will attack on sight.
Its primary method of offense is to charge at the target and use its large tusks to pierce the flesh of its prey.
