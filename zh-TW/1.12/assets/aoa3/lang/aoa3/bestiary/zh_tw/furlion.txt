Furlion, despite their name; are neither furry, or related to lions. Its name actually originates from a desert-dweller who once encountered one of these creatures and named it after himself.
Furlions are a migrant species, often found roaming across deserts in search of new sources of food and water. They are entirely herbivorous, and rely on the sparse vegetation in deserts to survive.

They tend to travel in packs, and will defend themselves and the pack vigorously from unknown creatures. When attacking, they will use their thick, strong skull as a battering ram, charging it straight into its target. Following an impact, they use their large, spring-like legs to launch themselves up and away from the target to avoid retaliation, before charging again.
This rather successful deployment of a hit-and-run tactic makes Furlions surprisingly deadly to deal with.
