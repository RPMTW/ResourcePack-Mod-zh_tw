Glistening pixons are the most well known pixons as they primarily appear in the overworld.
Initial studies on this pixon led to the breakthrough discovery of Kronic energy and the art of infusion.

Like all other pixons, when siphoned with a stone or diamond bowl, they drop a condensed formation of their energy in form of glistening infusion stones.
