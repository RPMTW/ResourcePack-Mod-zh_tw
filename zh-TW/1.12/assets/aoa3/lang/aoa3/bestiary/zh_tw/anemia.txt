Anemias appear during overworld bloodhunts as large, floating masses of red skin surrounding a giant eye.
Like the other bloodhunt creatures, their appearance is directly attributed to their Abyssal origins.

Their favourite pastime is to launch explosive energy balls at the direction of random targets with the hope of spreading their blood all across the nearby land.
Luckily though, their single eye doesn't give them very good depth perception, so you can usually avoid their blasts by standing still as little as possible.
