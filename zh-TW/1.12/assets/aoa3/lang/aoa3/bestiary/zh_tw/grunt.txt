Technically a member of the imp family, Grunts are short little pests that are known for taking great joy in causing general pain in anything it sees fit. Despite its small size, Grunts can move extremely quickly in short bursts, which it uses to its advantage as a way of quickly approaching potential victims.

While not necessarily aggressive, Grunts are considered hostile due to their persistently mischievous behaviour. Take this into consideration when travelling through the hills they tend to be found in, as their quick sprints can easily catch their targets off-guard.
