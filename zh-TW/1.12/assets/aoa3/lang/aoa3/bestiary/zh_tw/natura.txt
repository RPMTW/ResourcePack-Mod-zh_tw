Naturas are creatures of unknown origin, but it is often suspected they are otherworldly. Usually only found in coniferous areas, they like to use their natural colouring to blend into the flora.
They also have a strong natural draining effect when they come into contact with another living creature. Being affected by this may interfere with operation of blasters and other energy-sourcing weapons.

Being a general nuisance is apparently the only reason they exist, as they are not known to eat, drink, or perform any other primal activities.
They will attack without provocation, and it is suspected that their sustenance is fueled by draining energy from their targets.
