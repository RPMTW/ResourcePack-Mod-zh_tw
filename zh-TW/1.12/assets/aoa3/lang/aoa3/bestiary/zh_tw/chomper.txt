Chompers are large quadrupeds with very powerful forelimbs, which they use primarily for very quick movement through both water and on land. Being amphibious, Chompers are happy to live either on land or in the water, however do need to stay hydrated in order to survive.

Chompers will defend their land aggressively, attacking anyone who may approach them. Their two large tusks ensure that whoever they bite will not be getting away easily.
