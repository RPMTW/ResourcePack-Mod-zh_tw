A long-lost, primitive form of the Carrotop found in Gardencia, this strange creature is an anomaly seemingly only found within Precasia.
Even though it does have a much more primal appearance and demeanor, it seems to be equally aggressive and hostile as its Gardencian relative.

Testing appears to confirm that the Carrotop is a direct descendant of this creature, though the mechanics of which is not known.
