A large, brutish troll that once roamed the Overworld, Smash died off of natural causes many years ago. Recently however, a method has been discovered to bring back Smash in all his former glory, by artificially creating a totem which embodies his spirit.
No-one is really sure how this works, and studies are ongoing to try and discover the reasoning behind this miraculous occurrence, but to date no leads have been found.

Due to his very large size and strong muscles, Smash poses a very dangerous threat to any creature it targets. He carries a large club with him that he uses as a blunt-force weapon to great effectiveness.
His high strength and weapon of choice make a formidable opponent, and blows from Smash often result in hilarious situations such as being thrown dozens of meters to your death.
