An otherworldly creature, no-one is really sure where Cyclops originate from. What is known is that they can be found nearly anywhere, and aren't afraid to make their presence known.

They will attack at will, motioning very similarly to what you would expect from a human. There are currently no known instances of communication with a Cyclops, so it is recommended just to avoid them where possible.
