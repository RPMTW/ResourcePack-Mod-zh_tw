A lost autonomous robotic creature from ancient times, Sand Golems are most often found in desert areas, wandering around aimlessly.
Long ago, civilised tribes living in the desert discovered how to create animated robotic guards for their sand villages. Powered by the heat of the sun, they require no input and have one aim: guard.

Approaching one is not recommended, as their guarding motives are unchanged after hundreds of years and they will see you as an immediate threat.
