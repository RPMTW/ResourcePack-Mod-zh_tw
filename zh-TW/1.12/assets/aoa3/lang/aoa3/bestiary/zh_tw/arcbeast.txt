This quadrupedal bulky creature is very reminiscent of overworld cows. This makes sense, given that the citizens of the Shyrelands seem to consider Arcbeasts as such.
Like all other ocular Shyrelands creatures, its eyes have evolved to filter out the harsh light of the dimension, giving it a blue tint and reducing visible detail.

They are very timid, and likely to attack out of fear, charging their solid body into entities that frighten it.
