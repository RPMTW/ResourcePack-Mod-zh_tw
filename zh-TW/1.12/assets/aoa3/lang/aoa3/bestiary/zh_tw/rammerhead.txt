Rammerheads are a very large, bulky quadruped with a very noticeable cephalofoil head.
Despite its similarity in head shape to the hammerhead shark, it is actually entirely unrelated. Their head was evolved as a predatory advantage, allowing the creature to maintain a wider angle of view.

As they are natural predators, it is very common to find them charging at prey at high speeds. They then use their head to impact their target with high force, causing a lot of damage.
