The Toxic Lottoman can be found within the Vox Ponds. He seems to have adopted the same hiding strategy that the storekeepers use, as they are usually found hiding within vox crates inside destroyed storefronts.
Unlike the storekeepers however, the Toxic Lottoman is not interested in discussion or banter, and is singularly interested in selling his wares.
