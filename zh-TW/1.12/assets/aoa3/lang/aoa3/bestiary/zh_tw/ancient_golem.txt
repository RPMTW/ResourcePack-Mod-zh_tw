Made by unknown creators, Ancient Golems can occasionally be found roaming the overworld.
Due to their age, it is still unknown how their logical operation works, but either through failure or malicious intent, they are aggressive towards humans and seem uninterested in anything else.

They do not possess any weapons, so when attacking they just ram their rusting iron body into their target.
