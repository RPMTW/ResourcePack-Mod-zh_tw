Hunches are very strange beings. They were originally cold-water amphibious creatures, but at some point developed the ability to walk on land in a bipedal fashion. This stance causes their shoulders to rise up towards their head, hence the 'hunch' name.

Hunches will attack approaching creatures as they see them as a threat to their very limited available food sources.
