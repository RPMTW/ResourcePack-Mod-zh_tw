A large, bulky, cattle-like creature, Horndrons are not creatures you'd like to run into in an alley. Their primal instincts cause them to charge at unfamiliar creatures, with the intent of either impaling the target on their horns, or using them to toss the target over their head.

If encountered, it is recommended to take cover behind solid objects and run as far as possible so that it stops chasing you.
