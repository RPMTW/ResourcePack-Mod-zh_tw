Large, bulky, and intimidating. Black Ursas are a creature of the forests, preferring to live in coniferous areas due to their native fruits.
Despite their appearance, they are actually omnivores and are known to eat fruits, plants, and meats. Their long limbs allow them to reach higher plants and trees than other creatures, combined with their sharp teeth for pulling apart flesh.

Black Ursas hunt purely for food, and so you may find yourself being chased down by one in an effort to satiate themselves. Unfortunately, they're rarely satiated.
