Death Day (Event)

"Today is a good day to die."
Mortals run in fear, for the champions have arrived.
Death days occur on rare occasions, beginning with the rise of the sun. On these days, unusually tough creatures appear, ready to challenge those who have defied their weaker brethren.

Unless you're up for a challenge (or quick death), it's probably a good idea to hide away inside or underground, and wait for the day to pass.
