Creep Day (Event)

"The hissing sounds begin."
C.R.E.E.P has sent his heralds. This is not a good time to be in the business of fine china or glass.

During Creep Day, Creeper Hosts will spawn occasionally across the land. These hosts aren't very dangerous on their own, but the never-ending stream of Creepers that they bring with them can ruin even the most prepared adventurer.
