Big Day (Event)

"Today is a big day."
When the ground rumbles, it's time to run.
On rare days, the overworld will begin to shake under the footsteps of the giants. No-one really knows why or how this happens, but what we do know is that their big hulking frames are generally not nice to be squashed by.

Various giant constructs of the land will materialize and roam the grounds, seeking to crush nearby unwilling participants. They seem to be almost made from the lands that they roam, as if they came out of the ground itself.
Regardless, steer clear of the giants unless you fancy a self-pancake.
