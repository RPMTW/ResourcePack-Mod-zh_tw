Full Moon (Event)

"The ground bathes in the pearly light of the moon."
Beware the full moon, a time when strange creatures begin to appear.
During full moons, various dangerous creatures will spawn under the moonlight. These creatures are more powerful than the normal monsters you may encounter, so unless you're well set up, it might be wise to avoid them at all costs.

Once the full moon goes down, the creatures will begin to disappear again, leaving you with (relative) safety.
