The difference between a synchrotron is the maximum particle energy that can be inputted $(l)Eᵩ=(qB₂R)²/(2m)$() same as a $(l:multiblocks/accelerators/ring_accelerator#max_dipole)synchrotrons$(/l) form max dipole strength"

			"text": "The energy of the output particles is determined by the strength of the redstone signal applied to the controller. A full 15 strength will decelerate down to ~ 0 i.e less than 1 keV. This is required for creating neutral antimatter. For any redstone strength, the energy the decelerator will try to put the particles at is E=Eᵩ(1-Sᵣ/15) where Sᵣ is the redstone signal strength."
