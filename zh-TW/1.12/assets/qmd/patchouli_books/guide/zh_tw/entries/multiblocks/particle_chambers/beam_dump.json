They require one Particle Chamber Beam Port in input mode and a Particle Chamber Fluid Port in output mode."

Where the amount is the is the total pu supplied to finish the recipe i.e at 10 kpu/t a 1 kpu recipe will take 0.1 ticks to complete (so 10 recipes are completed a tick). The energy and focus in the recipe are both the minimum required. Normally for recipes this is 0 for both. If there is a maximum energy the recipe will say."
