	"§lBasics about neon crystal§r",
	"Basically, these crystalline semiconductor crystals can be divided into several subspecies. There are metallic and non-metallic, but also semi-organic and synthetic structures. ",
	"§nMetallic§r: neon crystal, retium crystal",
	"§nNonmetallic§r: glowtite crystal, alutin crystal",
	"§nSemi-organic§r: bioterium crystal",
	"§nSyntetic§r: wakurium crystal",
	"§lFormation§r",
	"Like many other crystal structures, these crystals grow through heat and pressure, with the exception of the organic category, which arises from bacterial metabolism. They usually form on a sandy nutrient medium, which is often referred to as granules. This nutrient medium often has the same properties of the crystals in a weakened form.",
	"§lProcessing§r",
	"Unlike diamonds, neon crystals consist predominantly of silicon compounds and therefore do not burn when heated. The melting point is just over 1400 ° C. The material is refined with the help of reduction melts, with the addition of carbon in the form of carbon or carbon monoxide gas. This creates handy bars that can be stored well. ",
	"§lProperties§r",
	"Unlike §kknown semiconductors§r, neon connections do not work with sub-zero temperatures, but only from approx. 100 ° C which allows them to react somewhat more slowly than normal copper conductors. However, due to the low resistance at these temperatures, the energy yield is far better than that of copper or gold. ",
	"Almost all neon crystals have a very low glow temperature, most of them start glowing at around 18 - 32 ° C. This is a typical identifier of this type of crystal and earned the first discovered specimen, the name neon crystal, because of the neon blue glow that it gave off. One suspects that there are far more species than are known to date. "
