	"This setup is a prototype of a Deepcore miner for testing. In order to ensure smooth operations make sure to have a strong power supply, the needed parts can be found in a chest nearby. Dont forget to install the industrial chips and the ram for best energy production of the infusion generators!",
	"To start the Deepcore miner install the supplied core & ram for enough processing power and activate the machine with your scrench. (NOTE: I added a big scrench on the block soo you can click at the wrong one!!! - why are our scientist like this ?!)",
	"First the bedrock rift must be scanned with a white lense. After that ores shold be produced via red lenses and green lenses can restore the bedrock rift to ensure it never runs out of ores.",
	"More of this will be available in your personal E-Scanning devices"
