    "While exploring the World, I have found another huge base. It is way bigger then a tech dungeon, and I don't know its purpose, maybe research?. It is build between the normal overworld and the nether and you can only enter it with a teleporter on the surface.",
    "Inside there are various places and locks with forcefields. I managed to unlock or rather pass one with a research I found nearby. The research unlocked a recipe so I could create a key and simply walked though the force field. And this place is even larger then I anticipated and it is very easy to get lost.",
