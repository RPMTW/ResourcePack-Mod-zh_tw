    "Sometimes I want to overclock my computers far more than what I am currently able to do. The ambient coolers are not able to support this level of overclocking and can take up a lot of room. To increase the capacity of my machiens without them overheating, I invented an active water-based cooling system.",
    "Since water boils at 100°C, steam generation and subsequent cooling only occur when the connected computer system reaches this point, also saving energy and resources.",

    },
    "I can place water buckets into the cooler directly, load them using item pipes, or provide water from pipes. However, steam is emitted from the top, so I can only work with inputs and outputs from the sides."
