	"In combination with some programming code, silicon, and some energy conductors made from copper, I developed a universal chipset, mainly functioning as a bridge between the processor and the rest of the components.",
	"Furthermore, this logic chipset will always contain the basic code for the processor, allowing the system to boot. For the time being, every system I create will need one of these chipsets.",
