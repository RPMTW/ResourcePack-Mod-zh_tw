	"As I was experimenting with neon currents, interrupting and rerouting them, I found that it may be possible to build more complex control systems.",
	"For the time being, coated silicon wafers appear to be the an ideal base material. Into them, I can insert a universal, computational base component, which I call a transistor.",
	"They operate fairly easily: there are separated input and output locations for energy. However, power cannot flow at all times; I must use a current to create a electric field at the input, which changes the material's properties, connecting the input and output.",
	"With enough of these transistors in series and parallel, I can presumably create any form of logic gate or control. But first I must develop a suitable crafting station...",
