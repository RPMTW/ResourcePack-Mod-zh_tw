	"With this Core series, I do believe that I have reached the limit of my current possibilities. I am not able to add any more units to a processor; they simply will not fit. Making them any smaller leads to strange effects where energy seems to be leaking out of the transistors. In this series, I upgraded the connectors inside the core to gold ones, as gold has much better conductivity.",
	"I also made an additional improvement by adding a built-in unit for the processing and output of Support data. This extremely relieved the work load on on the processor as a whole.",
