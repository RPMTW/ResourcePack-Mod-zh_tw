	"Using my studies in the field of thermodynamics, I developed an upgrade module for all computer-based systems.",
	"I can attach this module to any side of a machine (or even multiple sides), where it then releases heat to the environment. Depending on the ambient temperature (set by the biome), 1-3 additional heatpoints can be removed from the machine as long as the cooler is attached.",
	"The cooling efficiency of the unit is shown by a blue (3), green (2) or red (1) light on the front of the cooler.",
