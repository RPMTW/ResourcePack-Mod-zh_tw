    "I have noticed an interesting effect that occurs if I combine the transport chipset and the ultimate chipset.",
    "While the ultimate chipset normally makes the experience yield higher, this experience is normally lost when I automate a machine. This is not the case when both chips are installed, though!",
    "The ultimate chipset still boosts the experience amount gained, but if a crafted item is then moved by a transport chipset, the experience will drop out of the machine. First, I found that I could use a T3 Experience Research Module to collect them; but I came up with an even better idea.",
    "By installing a network chipset, the experience will be sent through the network cables and can be stored in any connected T3 modules. However, if no T3 module is connected (or if all modules are full), the experience will be lost.",
    "It seems that any machine supporting a transport chipset will allow this combined effect."
