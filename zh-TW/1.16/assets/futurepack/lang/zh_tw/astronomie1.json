	"There's an immense number of stars and planets out there, but almost all are well out of my reach. Even with my best ship, it would take many years to get to any but the nearest stars. Fortunately, quantum technology offers the potential to bypass certain laws of physics.",
	"If I can create an engine that uses this technology, I could reach every star in sight in nearly no time at all."
