One of the most adaptable birds in the overworld. Chargers are a known pest species of large flightless birds that seem intent on flocking towards potential attackers with no regard for safety.
Their long legs and flexible frame allows them great speed and mobility when running across land, beating out even some speedy quadrupeds.
The good news is that their mobile prowess is easily offset by their inherent fragility. If confronted by one, it's usually not too hard to dispatch with a few well-aimed hits.

Despite this, it is still worth taking caution, as their high speed and sharp beak can quickly overwhelm unsuspecting victims.
