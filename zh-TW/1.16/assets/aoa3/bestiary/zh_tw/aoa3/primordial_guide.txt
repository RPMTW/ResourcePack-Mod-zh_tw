The Primordial Guide is a friendly humanoid creature that stays in Dustopian villages offering help and advice to passing travellers.

Not long ago, when yet another religious group had gone into the Dustopian plains and disappeared forever, the Dustopian council decided that more publicly available information was needed to ensure that travellers would return safely.
To this effect, they set up the primordial guide program. The program allowed any dustopian citizen to sit through a course and become a registered guide.
