The aptly named Chimera is a creature with an unfortunate history. At some point in its evolutionary line, the Chimera's ancestor was born with a parasitic twin attached to its tail.
Unexpectedly, this parasitic twin turned out to be of great benefit to the Chimera as its additional set of eyes and ears, while still maintaining a connected brain stem allowed the creature to thrive.
Over time this evolutionary mistake became more common, eventually causing it to become the default design - through the magic of selective pressure.

As a somewhat expected downside, the additional eyes and ears require more energy to operate, and as such this has caused Chimeras to be constantly hungry and hunting for new food.
This, combined with the fact that they are carnivores, means that adventurers should avoid being their next meal by keeping their distance as best as possible.
