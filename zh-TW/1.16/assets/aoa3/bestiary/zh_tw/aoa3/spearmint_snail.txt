A green and white snail from Candyland, this peaceful creature very slowly crawls across the ground doing not much at all. They can sometimes be seen cleaning up some dead grass or leaves, as their sole source of food - however they don't tend to eat a lot.
Like other creatures from Candyland, the Spearmint Snail smells very much like their namesake candy; spearmint. As usual though, their smell is deceptive, and when licked they taste much more like a snail than they do candy.
