Surprisingly lightweight creatures, Goalbies are actually a species from the Haven dimension. They originally came to the overworld during the last great dimension clash, in which several species from a number of dimensions were leaked across their borders.
Their large wing-like appendages exude tiny spores that are easily dislodged. When they come in contact, these spores cause temporary muscle weakness and fatigue to most living species.

Like most Haven creatures, Goalbies are aggressive, and will attempt to attack even when unprovoked.
