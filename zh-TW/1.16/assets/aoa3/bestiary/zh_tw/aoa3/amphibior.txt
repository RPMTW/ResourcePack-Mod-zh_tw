The Amphibior is an aggressive bipedal creature from L'Borean that appears to be a resident of the aquatic castles.
Their watery coral-like build is noticeable as their body seems to exude water from its pores. It's suspected that this is used as a form of mitosis, as when semi-submerged, they appear to heal wounds very quickly from the water.

When attacking targets, their internal water production goes into overdrive, causing pools of water to form at their feet.
