Slow, brutish, and unintelligent, Sasquatches are a commonly seen creature that roams throughout plains and woodlands. Their lack of intelligence is effortlessly countered by their high physical strength, and taking one on physically may prove a challenge.

They have trouble recognising friend from foe, and have been known to attack humans because of this. Be aware of their presence and avoid if possible.
