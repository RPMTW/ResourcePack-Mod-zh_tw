One of the spiritual creations of the Immortallis dungeons, Skelekytes are humanoid constructs that are used by the dungeon as sacrificial tributes.
They appear to be used to test the situational awareness of trial participants, using their innate ability to temporarily turn invisible to confuse and cause disorder.

Like all Immortallis creations, it doesn't leave behind a corporeal form upon death, instead simply vanishing to return its energy to the dungeon.
