One of the spiritual creations of the Immortallis dungeons, the Fenix looks to have been created based on the form of sloths.
Its long lanky appendages and extremely sharp claws give it an unusual appearance, and it puts them to good use slashing at victims mercilessly.

Like all Immortallis creations, it doesn't leave behind a corporeal form upon death, instead simply vanishing to return its energy to the dungeon.
