The mortal enemy of anyone with a fear of more than 6 legs on one creature. Muckopedes are generally only found in dry areas where they can use their natural colouring to blend into the ground.
Where possible, they enjoy bathing in mud, though this doesn't seem to offer any functional benefits to the creature.

Muckopedes are easily spooked and will attack out of fright if approached. Their bite applies a minor nerve agent that can cause drowsiness and mild weakness for a short time.
