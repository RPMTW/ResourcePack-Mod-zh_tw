One of the spiritual creations of the Immortallis dungeons, Reavers have a distinct red colour and solid unyielding frame.
The dungeon uses them as a room guardian construct, adding obstacles to the various tasks required to be completed.

Their strong heavy leg-like appendages are used thoroughly, throwing targets back effortlessly.

Like all Immortallis creations, it doesn't leave behind a corporeal form upon death, instead simply vanishing to return its energy to the dungeon.
