The source of many myths and legends, the Fishix is a true monster of the swamps. Its origin is unknown, but it does seem to live solely in swamps and similar areas.
They seem to take great joy in scaring nearby creatures and travellers, and can often be found hiding just beneath water level before popping up and scaring a creature, using seaweed and mud to its aesthetic advantage.

Its very muscular body can make it a real threat in the even that you find yourself facing one. Its brute strength gives its swings enough force to deal serious damage, despite an absence of claws or other sharp appendages.
