A unicorn-like creature created by infusion creation power into a blank minion slab, the Alluricorn uses its natural speed and strong head to attack anything that threatens its owner.
Its imbued creation energy also reacts handily with kinetic runes, giving the owner a brief speed boost when in contact with them.
