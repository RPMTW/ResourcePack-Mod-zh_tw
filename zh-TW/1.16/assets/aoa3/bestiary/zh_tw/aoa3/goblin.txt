Goblins are generally considered a pest by most landowners and explorers, and are generally mostly well known for their destructive, provocative tendencies.
While technically a humanoid, Goblins are entirely unrelated to the human species, and evolved separately. Regardless of this, they have evolved some sort of primitive intellect, and are able to communicate with each other.
They are also able to interact with a basic form of magic, which they primarily use to shoot high-energy projectiles at whomever or whatever they see fit.

They aren't considered aggressive, however their constant pestering and tendency to fire projectiles at nearby creatures has caused them to be treated as if they are aggressive.
Deal with them with caution, as goblins like to work together, and can easily overwhelm if in groups.
