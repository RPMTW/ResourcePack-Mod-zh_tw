One of the spiritual creations of the Immortallis dungeons, this bulky construct appears to have been based off the appearance of deer.
As is common with most hostile Immortallis creations, the dungeon uses these as obstacles for its various tasks.

Like all Immortallis creations, it doesn't leave behind a corporeal form upon death, instead simply vanishing to return its energy to the dungeon.
