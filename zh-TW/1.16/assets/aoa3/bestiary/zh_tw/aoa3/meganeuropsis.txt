Don't like loud buzzing, fast moving wings, and grabby insect feet? This ancient dragonfly-predecessor is probably best avoided then.
Directly comparing Meganeuropsis to more modern dragonflies is a rather apt way of describing what this creature is and does. While it is significantly larger than its more recent cousins, it follows basically the same behavioural patterns.
Because of that, there's not a lot of interesting information regarding this creature, besides the fact that it is quite large in terms of insects.
