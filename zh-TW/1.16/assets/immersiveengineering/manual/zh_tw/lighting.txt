Engineered Lighting
點亮廢土
<&lantern>Deep in the halls of the factories, it can be quite dark. 為能夠在一大堆機器中摸回家，你最好在附近擺上一些燈籠。 為能夠在一大堆機器中摸回家，你最好在附近擺上一些燈籠。 燈籠提供與螢光石相同的亮度。
<&electric_lantern>Powered Lanterns are one of the first ever invented uses for electric power. To run these, you need to connect them directly to your power grid using wires. They will allow power to be transferred through them, so you can link them in a row.
Using the Engineer's Hammer on them will flip them upside down. As long as they are supplied with a little bit of power, they will light up the surrounding area like a normal Lantern, but additionally, they will also prevent hostile mobs to spawn in a 32 block radius!<np>
<&floodlight>Floodlights are strong lightsources. While they require more power than a simple Powered Lantern, they will create a cone of light up to 32 blocks long. Use an Engineer's Hammer on the top or bottom faces of the block to rotate the light or click its sides to change its pitch.
Generally, Floodlights require a redstone signal to run, however their control-behavior can be inverted by right-clicking them base with an Engineer's Screwdriver.
