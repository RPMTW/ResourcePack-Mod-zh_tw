    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.hallowed_gold_a": "Gold is very often used as a basis for various magics, this is also the case with spirit arcana.

    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.holy_sap_b": "Holy extract can be used for quite a few things. Firstly, by combining it with a slimeball you'll obtain sapballs. Since sapballs are equal to slimeballs the crafting process results in triple the slime.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.holy_sap_c": "Secondly, you can create holy syrup by heating up your sap.

    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.introduction_a": "Within this world, every living body has a soul. The body is a physical vessel that the soul occupies. The soul is one's consciousness and what animates the body. Both represent who you are, one physically, the other magically.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.introduction_b": "The encyclopedia arcana is a book that documents all that is known about arcane presence within this world.

    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.introduction_d": "The magical presence of a soul derives almost entirely from the spirits found within it. They may be dormant, but they are there. Each different soul is one and only, made up of different quantities of different spirits.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.iridescent_ether_a": "In contrast to most other magical lights aside from pleasing the eye ether has a double flame colored variant, iridescent ether. This pristine form of ether allows you to dye the item once more to alter the ending color of the burn. Much like normal ether it can be placed on a brazier and a torch",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.iridescent_ether_b": "Getting just the right coloring for your light may be a bit tricky however. You cannot alter the original color of ether once it's transformed into it's iridescent variant, applying any dye at this stage will only change the second color.",

    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.necklace_of_the_mystic_mirror": "A whole lot of gear, trinkets and armor alike grant an effect when collecting spirits.

    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.necklace_of_the_narrow_edge": "The scythe sweep attack can be extremely useful in clearing through hordes of prey, however in other cases it can be seen as unnecessary or even impractical. This iron necklace will completely remove your scythe's sweep attack in exchange for a strong damage increase.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.rebound": "The rebound enchantment is by far the strangest one of all. It grants you the ability to throw the scythe like a boomerang, allowing for a wacky ranged attack. Higher tiers allow you to throw the scythe more frequently.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ring_of_curative_talent": "Tears of the ghast have some really strong curative properties. Combining one with some sacred arcana and infusing both into a gilded ring will yield us the ring of curative talent. This simple trinket will recover a large portion of your health when collecting spirits.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ring_of_prowess_a": "There is another thing besides spirit arcana that the soul holds, it is known as brilliance, or experience. Unlike spirits, brilliance has strong enough ties to the body and some of it is naturally dispersed from the soul upon the defeat of the vessel.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ring_of_prowess_b": "As with all things, we can't let the soul keep anything for itself. With some clever use of raw arcana combined with natural brilliance we can leech off some extra experience as spirits leave the dying soul. The ring of prowess does just that.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ring_of_wicked_intent": "The wicked ring is a simple yet practical trinket that will greatly assist you in combat. Taking note from the powerful wither army the ring will react to nearby spirit arcana and reward you with strength and rage when collecting spirits.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.runewood_a": "Similarly to soulstone, the runewood tree is yet another result of uncontrolled spirit infusion. This time however the result is rather unexpected from soul magics. Apart from being a good conductor for arcana, the tree doesn't pose much of a threat at all. How boring.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.runewood_b": "Runewood trees are created with arcane and sacred spirit, hence their tame nature. Unlike the soulstone, this process is rather quick in comparison and can easily be replicated.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.sacred_rite": "The sacred rite is the simplest rite there is. It'll provide a weak healing effect to all nearby players.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.sacred_spirit_a": "Sacred spirit derives from two concepts, the pure and the holy. Sacred arcana is generally focused on various forms of healing and other curative effects.",

    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.scythes_a": "The scythe is a very popular tool amongst soul hunters. To start, it provides a strong sweeping attack, even more powerful than the sword. Perfect for clearing through hordes of prey. Additionally, and most importantly it damages the soul and body with each attack.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.scythes_b": "When you damage a living body you destroy the vessel of a soul. However if you damage both the body and the soul you'll be able to completely eradicate your enemy, this way of mercilessly executing your enemy is known as shattering their soul and serves as the basic way of obtaining spirits.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.scythes_c": "The most primitive scythe available is the crude one, made from iron and a single soulstone.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soul_hunter_armor": "The soul hunter set is an offense focused piece of equipment made from spirit fabric. At the cost of below average protection the armor set boosts magic and scythe damage dealt by the user.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soul_stained_armor_a": "Just like with the crude scythe, you're able to reinforce iron armor with soul stained steel. In addition to providing near diamond levels of protection the armor also shields you from magic damage. On top of that collecting spirits while wearing the armor set will reward you with a brief resistance effect.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soul_stained_armor_b": "Wearing an armor set made out of soul stained steel could be compared to wearing one made out of active uranium, you would most certainly die a slow death. To prevent this unfortunate scenario, the armor is built with a protective twisted rock layer underneath the dangerous steel.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soul_stained_scythe": "After some time using the crude scythe you may start wishing for an upgrade or a stronger version, just like the one made from soul stained steel. It is a direct upgrade with slightly increased physical damage and a bonus to magic damage triggered by the scythe.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soul_stained_steel_a": "The sacred origins of hallowed gold make it nearly impossible to use for harm. Soul stained steel is nothing like that, it's a tough metal twisted evil beyond recognition. It excels at heartless crimes, perfect for various gear and trinkets.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soul_stained_steel_b": "Any piece of gear made from soul stained steel is capable of shattering souls.

    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulstone_a": "The soulstone is a strange ore found both on the surface and in the deepslate layer of your world. The ore itself is created when wicked spirit is infused into carbon based minerals such as coal or diamond.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulstone_b": "Sadly this process takes an unbelievably long time, it's nearly impossible to replicate. At the end of it, a soul-reactive material was brought into this world. Due to it's origins, soulstone is a great catalyst for soul magics and other diabolical fields.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulstone_c": "To be more specific, wicked spirit found within the soulstone is so concentrated  that when brought close to an arcane presence it can be easily damaged. Furthermore, any piece of gear made from soulstone will be able to damage souls.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulwood_a": "Spirit magics focus on turning everything good in the world to evil. Sometimes, by pure coincidence a great thing is created instead, as is the case with runewood. It is important to realize this mistake and correct it.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulwood_b": "By utilizing the dangerous arcane spirit rite we can easily create soulwood, any nearby runewood block is a valid target for this transmutation. Much like it's name implies, soulwood has a strong connection to more direct soul magics. It'll be sure to come in use.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_alchemy": "You may often find yourself scavenging for simple physical ingredients while having too much raw arcana to spend.

    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_infusion_b": "Some recipes may also ask for additional reagents to be infused into the prime item.

It's a placeable jar block that can store a really really large amount of a single spirit, very convenient to have next to a spirit altar.

    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_plunder": "The spirit plunder enchantment forces the scythe's soulstone to utilize even more magic, any soul you shatter with this enchanted scythe will yield extra spirits. This may however damage the soulstone, taking extra durability off of your scythe.",
