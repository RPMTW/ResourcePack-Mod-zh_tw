They're filled with plenty of inexplicable things of unknown origin, automaton-like guardians, drowned risen from the undead, various ruins and monuments, there's too much we don't know. Aqueous sorcery is extremely potent, but usually hard to come by",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.arcane_charcoal": "Due to the esoteric origins of the arcane oak, charcoal created from runewood is extra efficient and can burn for twice as long. You may also turn it into several smaller pieces, much like with other fuels you're more accustomed to.",

    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ether_a": "Nowadays, most magics offer you a unique source of light for all purpose use, spirit arcana is no different. Ether, known to some as Nitor is a magical flame that burns and shines bright forever. It can be placed on a torch or a magical brazier which can be placed or hung.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ether_b": "Additionally, the ether flame can be dyed into practically any color.

    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.holy_sap_a": "Within the runewood trees a special type of sap is created. To get your hands on this holy extract you'll need an axe. Start by stripping off the bark of an exposed piece of runewood, and then collect it all with a glass bottle.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.holy_sap_b": "Holy sap can be used for quite a few things. Firstly, by combining it with a slimeball you'll obtain several sapballs, which serve the same purpose.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.holy_sap_c": "Secondly, you can create holy syrup by heating up your sap. Drinking this rejuvenating substance will replenish plenty of hunger and even provide you with a healing effect.",

    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.introduction_a": "Within our world, every living body has a soul. The soul is one's consciousness and what animates the body, a physical vessel for the arcane presence of a soul.

    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.introduction_d": "The power of a specific soul derives almost entirely from the spirits found within it's core.

    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.iridescent_ether_a": "While ether is exceptionally gorgeous, iridescent ether takes this glimmering shine a step further. This pristine form of ether allows you to dye the item once more to alter the ending color of the burn. Much like normal ether it can be placed on a brazier and a torch",

    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.necklace_of_the_mystic_mirror": "A whole lot of gear, trinkets and armor alike grant an effect when collecting spirits. By utilizing primitive mirror magic we can siphon some raw arcana off of your magic attacks and utilize it to trigger those effects. This necklace does just that.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.necklace_of_the_narrow_edge": "The scythe sweep attack can be extremely useful in clearing through hordes of prey, however in other cases it can be seen as unnecessary or even impractical. This iron necklace will completely remove your scythe's sweep attack in exchange for a strong damage increase.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.rebound": "The rebound enchantment is by far the strangest one of all. It grants you the ability to throw the scythe like a boomerang, allowing for a wacky ranged attack. Higher tiers allow you to throw the scythe more frequently.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ring_of_curative_talent": "Tears of the ghast have some really strong curative properties. Combining one with some sacred arcana and infusing both into a gilded ring will yield us the ring of curative talent. This simple trinket will recover a large portion of your health when collecting spirits.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ring_of_prowess_a": "There is another thing besides spirit arcana that the soul holds, it is known as brilliance, or experience. Unlike spirits, brilliance has strong enough ties to the body and some of it is naturally dispersed from the soul upon the defeat of the vessel.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ring_of_prowess_b": "As with all things, we can't let the soul keep anything for itself. With some clever use of raw arcana combined with natural brilliance we can leech off some extra experience as spirits leave the dying soul. The ring of prowess does just that.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ring_of_wicked_intent": "The wicked ring is a simple yet practical trinket that will greatly assist you in combat. Taking note from the powerful wither army the ring will react to nearby spirit arcana and reward you with strength and rage when collecting spirits.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.runewood_a": "Similarly to soulstone, the runewood tree is yet another result of uncontrolled soul magic. This time however the nature of the result is much less grim. These trees are known for their life giving sap and for their wood; a fine arcana conductor.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.runewood_b": "Runewood trees are created with arcane and sacred spirit, hence their tame nature. Unlike the soulstone, this process is rather quick in comparison and can easily be replicated with a good understanding of soul magic.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.sacred_rite": "The sacred rite is the simplest rite there is. It'll provide a weak healing effect to all nearby players.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.sacred_spirit_a": "Sacred spirit represents two main concepts, pure beings and holy origins. Sacred arcana is generally focused on various forms of healing and other curative effects.",

    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.scythes_a": "The scythe is a very popular tool amid soul hunters. For one, it provides a strong sweeping attack even more powerful than that of the sword. Secondly, due to the soulstone augmented into the scythe it's capable of damaging both the soul and body with each attack.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.scythes_b": "When you damage a living body you destroy the vessel of a soul, letting it fade away peacefully into the afterlife. However when you slay a soul, you will shatter it alongside the death of the vessel. This merciless execution denies the soul eternal peace and is your key to obtaining your very first batch of spirit arcana.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.scythes_c": "The most primitive scythe available is a crude one, made from iron and a single soulstone.",

    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soul_stained_armor_a": "Just like with the scythe, you're able to reinforce iron armor with soul stained steel. In addition to providing near diamond levels of protection the armor also shields you from magic damage. On top of that, the armor grants you a protective barrier known as soul ward.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soul_stained_armor_b": "Soul ward is a potent arcane shield designed for magic attacks. It will recover over time, and absorb almost all of magic damage taken as well as a small amount of physical damage. It's commonly used, and utilized by many trinkets.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soul_stained_scythe": "After some time using the crude scythe you may grow tired of the weak weapon. The soul stained steel scythe is a direct upgrade with overall higher damage distributed between physical and magic.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soul_stained_steel_a": "The sacred origins of hallowed gold make it nearly impossible to use for harm. Soul stained steel is nothing like that, it's a tough metal twisted evil beyond recognition. It excels at heartless crimes, perfect for various gear and trinkets.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soul_stained_steel_b": "Any piece of gear made from soul stained steel is capable of shattering souls and deals both magic and physical damage.

    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulstone_a": "The soulstone is a strange mineral found both nearby the surface and in the deepslate layer of our world. The ore itself is created when wicked spirit is infused into carbon based minerals such as coal or diamond.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulstone_b": "Sadly this process takes an unbelievably long time and furthermore it's nearly impossible to safely replicate in a reasonable amount of time, you'll have to find the mere leftovers of uncontrolled soul magic. Due to it's arcane origins, soulstone is a great catalyst for soul magics and other diabolical fields.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulstone_c": "To be exact, wicked spirit is known for being especially capable of harming the soul, furthermore due to the high concentration of wicked arcana within the soulstone, any piece of gear augmented with the gem will be able to harm the soul.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulwood_a": "Spirit magics focus on turning everything good in the world to evil. Sometimes, by pure coincidence a great thing is created instead, as is the case with runewood. It is important to realize this mistake and correct it.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulwood_b": "By utilizing the dangerous arcane spirit rite we can easily create soulwood, any nearby runewood block is a valid target for this transmutation.

    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_alchemy": "You may often find yourself scavenging for simple physical ingredients while having too much raw arcana to spend.

    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.crucible_acceleration_a": "The crucible is a rather heavy and slow piece of spirit engineering, and that is not without a reason. For you see; the impetus can be really easily damaged, the process of spirit focusing heavily relies on a slow and constant input of arcana to not cause unnecessary damage to the catalyst.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.crucible_acceleration_b": "Increasing the rate at which arcana is streamed into the impetus would yield a faster result but it could lead to your catalyst getting damaged more than necessary. With that in mind the spirit catalyzer is a heavily augmented pedestal designed specifically for utilizing solid fuel to accelerate a nearby machination.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.crucible_acceleration_c": "Each nearby spirit catalyzer will amplify the speed of the crucible at the cost of greater risk of catalyst instability, you may observe exponentially higher results with each new catalyzer; reaching the limit at 8.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.crystal_creation": "By utilizing more complex combinations of spirits in spirit focusing you may naturally expect more complex results, this is very much the case. You may create various gems from all corners of your world using spirit focusing.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.expanded_focusing_a": "Furthermore, arcane restoration isn't restricted to just repairing your impetus; it extends much further. Using the restoring process you may repair any one of your damaged items.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.expanded_focusing_b": "Each item will require a unique set of spirits that need to be slotted in the crucible as well as a valid repair ingredient aimed at the crucible in the twisted tablet.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.expanded_focusing_c": "Additionally, gear closely connected with spirit arcana can be repaired more efficiently.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.impetus_restoration_a": "When an impetus sustains enough damage it will crack, becoming unusable for spirit focusing. To combat this issue, the crucible has a secondary function known to most as arcane restoration. This process expands on spirit focusing and flips it upside down.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.impetus_restoration_b": "Instead of splitting off mass from our catalyst such as the impetus, arcane restoration utilizes spirit arcana to recover the form of your item. While repairing an impetus with the crucible alone is theorized to be possible, there's no reason not to take the easy way out.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.impetus_restoration_c": "The twisted tablet is a simple augmentation of your usual item stand; the difference is that the tablet has the ability to channel spirit arcana without the need for an outside source to draw it out. It must be placed facing the crucible on a matching axis position.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.metallurgic_magic_a": "With some clever tricks you may imbue your impetus with a metallic shell, when fed spirits it'll sprout a metallic node of your desired metal which you may then smelt directly into nuggets. Due to the more rigid material of the impetus, more durability is lost in the process.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.metallurgic_magic_b": "It is speculated that these catalysts were previously used as some sort of ashen aspects in an infernal arcana focused alchemical exchange system. It might be possible to replicate the process by studying the history of infernal arcana.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.runewood_c": "Additionally, item holders such as pedestals or stands can be created using runewood planks. These simple receptacles are often used as means of supplying your magical processes with ingredients.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.runewood_d": "The runewood tree can be found commonly within various plains and fields alike, and also rarely within forest biomes.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_focusing_a": "The spirit crucible is a wondrous device created to operate on items using an alchemical process named spirit focusing. It revolves around a single key catalyst and the interactions of it and spirit arcana. One of the more common catalysts found in this magical process is an alchemical impetus.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_focusing_b": "The impetus is a clay-made artifact of ancient design, it's very easy to shape it's earthen mass into new form. By utilizing spirits in the crucible you may shape some of the impetus' mass into something new at the cost of a slight toll on the clay artifact's durability.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.the_device": "even works while bended",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.tyrving_a": "The Tyrving is a rather esoteric blade. It's strange design makes it appear as a weak weapon not suited for combat. However, it's hex ash lining and twisted rock form cause it to deal extra magic damage to the soul, the greater the soul the more benefit.",
    "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.tyrving_b": "The weapon can also be repaired using arcane restoration quite efficiently.",
