The first piece of equipment one shall create is the $(l:conjuring:basics/soulfire_forge)Soulfire Forge$(), required to form the elementary $(l:conjuring:basics/soul_composite_materials)Soul Composite Materials$(). Moving forward, constructing a $(l:conjuring:basics/conjurer)Conjurer$() as well as a $(l:conjuring:basics/conjuring_scepter)Conjuring Scepter$() and $(l:conjuring:basics/conjuring_focus)Conjuring Focus$() is in order."

This may be refined using the practices outlined in $(l:conjuring:basics/basic_gem_tinkering)Basic Gem Tinkering$(). After having gained some experience with souls, creating $(thing)Soul Alloy Tools$() may be of interest. These prestigious instruments can be enhanced through $(l:conjuring:soul_alloy_tools/advanced_gem_tinkering)Advanced Gem Tinkering$(). Crafting them however, requires the $(l:conjuring:rituals/ritual_of_weaving)Ritual of Weaving$() to be carried out."
