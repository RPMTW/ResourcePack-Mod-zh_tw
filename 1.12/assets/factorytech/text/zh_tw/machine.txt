$title Machine Basics
Most machines process items in some way, having one or a few inputs and likewise for outputs. They also have slots for the parts that they use in the upper right corner of the GUI. Shift-clicking the icon of a machine part will immediately break the part that the machine is using.
$title Chop Saw
$recipe machines/saw
The Chop Saw applies wide, straight cuts to materials. Its main use is to convert logs into planks and planks into sticks more efficiently than by hand. It can also slice Quartz Blocks into blank circuit board substrates.
$machine TileEntitySaw
$end
$title Grindstone
$recipe machines/grindstone
The Grindstone, simply put, sharpens things. It converts Gears into Saw Blades and Nickel Ingots into Cutting Blades. In addition, it can apply one level of Efficiency or Sharpness to tools or weapons, to a maximum of III, at the cost of 25% of its remaining durability.
$machine TileEntityGrindstone
$end
$title River Grate
$recipe machines/sluice
The River Grate collects metal nuggets that wash down rivers to generate a slow but steady supply of iron, copper, and nickel. It can also collect fish swimming downstream. To run, it must be in a River biome between y-level 60 and 70, and must be surrounded by sufficient water.
The metal that washes down rivers is generally of poorer quality. It is only suitable for use in machine parts, and parts made from river metal will slightly worse than normal.
$machine TileEntitySluice
$end
$title Metal Cutting Machine
$recipe machines/metalcutter
The Metal Mill is a more precise cutting machine than the Chop Saw, intended for precise metal cutting. Its main use is to cut wire from copper and gold ingots, but it can also make gears *much* more efficiently than by hand.
$machine TileEntityMetalCutter
$end
$title Scrap Furnace
The Scrap Furnace is one of the more important machines, as it converts broken parts back into metal nuggets that can be repurposed. However, it is not 100% efficient, and the material equivalent of one or two nuggets will be lost for each reclaimed part.
$machine TileEntityReclaimer
$end
$title Autocrafting Unit
$machine TileEntityAutoCrafter
$recipe machines/autocrafter
$recipe automation/craftblocker
The Autocrafting Unit, when given items in the shape of a valid recipe, will automatically craft said recipe and balance the input stack sizes as needed. It will not do a craft if any input stacks would be left empty unless said items do not stack in the first place.
$page
Crafting Slot Blockers can be used to take up empty slots in a recipe. The autocrafter will ignore them, but they will prevent automation from putting items into those slots.
$end
$title Woodcutter
$recipe machines/woodcutter
The Woodcutter will chop down any trees that grow directly in front of it, making it a key component for farming. It takes some time to fully cut through the tree, but will harvest the entire tree at once when it does.
$machine TileEntityWoodcutter
$end
$title Drill Grinder
$recipe machines/drill
The Drill Grinder is, well, a drill that grinds things. It can convert one Ore block into two units of dust, each of which can be smelted into an ingot; it can also convert stone to gravel and gravel to sand.
$machine TileEntityOreDrill
$end
$title Magnetizer
$recipe machines/magnetizer
The Magnetizer's one and only job is to magnetize iron ingots. To do this, it rotates them at extreme speeds while subjecting them to an alternating current field. In addition to the normal machine parts, it requires a constant, alternating on/off Redstone signal to run.
$machine TileEntityMagnetizer
$end
$title Electric Furnace
$recipe machines/elecfurnace
The Electric Furnace, in addition to smelting slightly faster than a regular Furnace, can handle a few extra recipes that require a more precise temperature.
$machine TileEntityHTFurnace
$end
$title Centrifuge
$recipe machines/centrifuge
The Centrifuge, as you would expect, spins things around fast enough that they separate into their components. In addition to getting an extra nugget from ore dusts, it can reliably extract flint from gravel.
$machine TileEntityCentrifuge
$end
$title Magnetic Centrifuge
$recipe machines/magcent
The Magnetic Centrifuge is a specialized version of the Centrifuge that uses magnetism to separate iron and nickel from non-metals. Many things contain trace amounts of these metals, so this can be a way to generate extra.
In order to form a slurry that the metals can be taken out of, the Magnetic Centrifuge requres water to run.
$machine TileEntityMagnetCentrifuge
$end
$title Crucible
$recipe machines/crucible
The Crucible applies high enough temperatures to solids that they melt. It can also melt Netherrack into Lava and Glowstone into a liquid which makes up one of the components of Energite. If for some bizarre reason you need to turn ice back into water, it can do that too.
$machine TileEntityCrucible
$end
$title Potion Mixer
$recipe machines/potionmixer
While many aspiring alchemists have sought a way to cram more than one effect into a bottle, potions seem to be averse to mixing when poured together. The Potion Mixer remedies that by piping normal potions into a central basin and then churning them until the different properties are forced together.
$machine TileEntityPotionMixer
$end
$title Circuit Scribe
$recipe machines/circuitscribe
The Circuit Scribe etches circuit patterns onto blank quartz plates. One of four patterns must be specified by the GUI; different machines require different circuit patterns. For further information on circuits, see their page in the Parts Specifications.
$machine TileEntityCircuitScribe
$end
$title Seed Disperser
$recipe machines/planter
The Seed Disperser scatters wheat, pumpkin, melon, or beetroot seeds, as well as potatoes, carrots, and Nether Wart, in a 9x9 area around it. The area can be increased using a Range upgrade. It must be placed on the same y-level as the soil blocks to function properly.
$machine TileEntityPlanter
$end
$title Mining Machine
$recipe machines/autominer
The Mining Machine will automatically dig a wide hole down to bedrock, outputting all block drops. It works similarly to other models, though it is a bit more... "interesting"... than some others. By default it digs a 7x7 hole; a Range upgrade increases this to 15x15.
$page
Beyond being a simple quarry, the Mining Machine is able to catch smaller chunks of ore that would normally be missed. Each time it breaks a Stone block, it has a chance of finding an Ore Chunk, which can give different metals depending on how it is processed. In addition, it extracts double the normal amount of Coal per ore and has a very small chance of turning up extra diamonds.
$machine TileEntityAutoMiner
$end
$title Industrial Electroplater
$recipe machines/electroplater
The Industrial Electroplater dissolves materials in sulphuric acid and then uses an electric current to plate them onto wires. It can electroplate ore dusts to double them again as well as turning Redstone into Glowstone and sand into quartz. It must have the desired output product placed into the slot above the output, so that there is something for it to electroplate onto.
$machine TileEntityElectroplater
$end
$title Mob Disassembler
$recipe machines/disassembler
The Mob Disassembler rapidly damages any creature (save for Players) that stands on top of it; in addition, mobs killed by it will drop much more loot than normal. Some may even drop loot they normally couldn't.
A Redstone signal disables it.
$machine TileEntityDisassembler
$end
$title Fluid Drill
$recipe machines/fluiddrill
The Fluid Drill digs a narrow, deep hole into the Earth and extracts either sulphur or propane, depending on where you place it. To function there must be a clear shaft down to bedrock below it.
$machine TileEntityFluidDrill
$end
$title Fluid Agitator
$recipe machines/agitator
A key component in producing many resources, the Agitator churns up to two fluids and one item together to output up to one item and one fluid. Its main use is to produce sulphuric acid from sulphur and water.
$machine TileEntityAgitator
$page
Water + Lava -> Stone
Sulphur + Water -> Sulphuric Acid
Liquefied Glowstone + Monster Dust -> Energite
Sand + Water -> Clay
Concrete Powder + Water -> Concrete
Redstone + Sulphur -> Blaze Powder
Leaves + Water -> Slimeball
Rotten Flesh + Sulphuric Acid -> Leather
$end
$title Refrigeration Unit
$recipe machines/refrigerator
The Refrigerator cools liquids until they solidify, freezing water into ice and lava into obsidian. Oddly enough, it can also convert propane into coal.
$machine TileEntityRefrigerator
$end
$title Compression Chamber
$recipe machines/compressionchamber
$recipe parts/tankitem
The Compression Chamber compresses fluids to be stored in tanks; this can be done with water, propane, and sulphuric acid. In addition, attempting to fill a tank when the Compression Chamber's own tank is empty will instead fill it with compressed air. Finally, it is also used to fill Energy Core shells with Energite.
$machine TileEntityCompressionChamber
$end
$title Propane Furnace
$recipe machines/propanefurnace
The Propane Furnace uses compressed propane tanks to smelt items extremely quickly. One tank is good for eight smelts; however, it cannot do the precise recipes of the Electric Furnace.
Full tanks are inserted on the bottom; empty ones are pulled from the top.
$end
$title Mounted Blowtorch
$recipe machines/blowtorch
The Mounted Blowtorch, beyond being a nifty form of base defense, also smelts items even faster than the Propane Furnace. It consumes propane, and quite a lot of it; however, it will quickly cook anything in front of it.
Its current temperature can be checked using a Magnifying Glass. It will only smelt when above 500 degrees Celsius, and it becomes more fuel efficient above 800 degrees. Allowing its temperature to rise above 900C is... not advised.
It requires a Redstone signal to run.
$end
$title Tempering Oven
$recipe machines/temperer
Some machine parts can be tempered to increase their strength, and therefore their lifespan in machines. It can also temper iron ingots, which are used in crafting some higher-end machines, and iron tools, giving the equivalent of an Unbreaking I enchantment (doesn't stack). To run, it needs a sustained Redstone signal.
$machine TileEntityTemperer
$page
The Tempering Oven is not self-regulating. The Redstone signal must be turned off at exactly the right time; this time varies depending on the parts.
If the signal turns off too early, the process will simply fail; if it stays on for too long, the part will be destroyed.
Note that the tempering will not complete until the signal is actually turned off - removing the part will not suffice.
$page
All tempering processes have a tolerance of +/- 2 ticks.

Iron Ingot -> Tempered Iron Ingot: 79 ticks
Saw Blade -> Tempered Saw Blade: 73 ticks
Basic Gear -> Tempered Gear: 66 ticks
Drillbit -> Tempered Drillbit: 89 ticks
Nickel Cutting Blade -> Tempered Cutting Blade: 54 ticks
Applying Unbreaking to tools and weapons: 116 ticks
$end
$title Core Charger
$recipe machines/corecharger
This machine runs an intense electric current through unfinished energy cores, charging them up. It is important to note that fully charging cores is extremely dangerous; optimal efficiency is achieved at 80%. Above that causes it to take longer to stabilize, and charging a core above 100% can cause an explosive overflow.
$machine TileEntityCoreCharger
$end
$title Stabilization Table
$recipe machines/stabilizer
$recipe machines/magnetblock
To stabilize a charged Energy Core for use in machines, it must be put on a Stabilization Table and surrounded with active Redstone Magnets. See "Core Stabilization" in the Parts section for more information.
$end
$title Biosynthesis Unit
$recipe machines/spawner
The Biosynthesizer, although unable to fully duplicate the Mob Spawners found in dungeons, comes close. Given the necessary parts and a sample of the creature's drops (to clone from), it can produce a steady supply of them which are dropped directly under it.
$machine TileEntitySpawner
$end
$title Mob Disruptor
$recipe machines/disruptor
The Mob Disruptor emits powerful radio waves that, while harmless to players, freeze mobs in place. In addition, it stops Endermen from teleporting.
$machine TileEntityDisruptor
$end
$title Negative Ion Disperser
$recipe machines/iondisperser
The Negative Ion Disperser releases charged particles that improve the health and morale of nearby players and mobs. In more concrete terms, it gives nearby creatures random burst of either Speed, Jump Boost, Haste, Strength, or Regeneration.
$machine TileEntityIonDisperser
$end
$title Tesla Coil
$recipe machines/teslacoil
This machine builds up electric charge to zap mobs and players, making it a powerful form of base defence. Any creature wearing a full suit of Chainmail armour is immune to it as the chainmail forms a Faraday cage.
$machine TileEntityTeslaCoil
$end
$title Terraneous Extractor
$recipe machines/deepdrill
By focusing the power of an Energy Core through a lens, this machine is able to drill a small hole through the Bedrock at the bottom of the world and extract the rich supply of minerals that lie below. To function, it must be at or below Y-level 8.
$machine TileEntityDeepDrill
$end
$title Dynamos
$recipe machines/batterygen
$recipe machines/coregen
The factories that can be built are elaborate and elegant, filled with processing lines and conveyor belts. However, some opt for the more easy solution of placing down a row of machines, hooking them up to tubes of molten redstone, and forgetting about them. While this solution is less glamorous, it is desirable at times.
$page
The Electric Dynamo generates RF from Batteries, while the Core Conversion Dynamo generates it from Energy Cores. The Electric Dynamo generates a constant 30 RF per tick, with Energite batteries lasting twice as long as standard ones. The Core Conversion Dynamo generates an average of 120 RF per tick, which varies sinusoidally between 240 RF/t and zero.
$end
$title Universal Supercharger
$recipe machines/energizer
Accomplishing a similar task to those strange, light-blue spinning circles, the Universal Supercharger can be placed adjacent to any machine, and indeed almost any device, to make it run twice as fast. To function, it requires a steady supply of Energy Cores. Applying a Redstone signal disables it.
$end
