Document is an item which is used for placing a structure with an SCP (containment chamber). It won't place the chamber
if there are any unbreakable blocks or blocks with tile entities in the way. You can place a preview of the chamber
area by Shift + right clicking - it will place grey outline blocks of the chamber, blue outline blocks of the door
positions and a green outline block where you are supposed to click again if the location of the chamber suits you.
These blocks will disappear after 15 seconds by themselves, but you can change this value in options. The chamber
usually has a door entrance. You will need keycard(s) to trigger the card readers that might happen to be inside the
chamber.
