Token is an item which can be combined with a Blank document in the document crafter to obtain an appropriate
SCP document. Every Token has a unique recipe. If the option "Unlock all knowledge immediately" is false in the mod
config, then right-clicking a token will unlock some in-game info about the associated SCP.
