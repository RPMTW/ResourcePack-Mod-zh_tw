3-D Specs

If a player puts these glasses on, he will start seeing large bipedal entities. Entities reportedly
exhibit a docile behavior, with one exception. Any attempt by the wearer or any other
personnel to directly interact with the entities results in severe lacerations suddenly appearing on persons involved.
If a player attacks or collides with mentioned entities, they will attack him.
They despawn after 20 seconds.
