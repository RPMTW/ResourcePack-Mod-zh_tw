Eyeball

It's a creature consisting of an eyeball and supporting stalk made of blood vessels. It stares at nearby living
entities. Eyeball will force a nearby player to look at it after 7 seconds of staring. This look lock can be removed
by walking outside of the eyeball's detection range or by hiding behind an obstacle. Non-player targets will be forced
to attack the eyeball (if they are able to).
On death an eyeball explodes into pieces, infecting all living entities in 8 block radius. After some time, a new
eyeball will emerge from infected entity, damaging it by half of max health amount. This seems like the only method of
its reproduction.
Look lock can be negated by a set of Telekill armor.
