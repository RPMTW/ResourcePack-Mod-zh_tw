Mesozoic Chicken Coop

This is a block which transforms chickens into semi-avian, semi-reptiloid creatures similar to Pyroraptor olympius.
Transformation takes place every minute inside a 15 block range from the coop; it will transform up to 15 chickens in
that area. The creatures are hostile to humans.
