Haunter in the Dark

It's a small green soapstone statue, 30 cm in height. Any player that views the Haunter in 40 blocks
radius becomes its target; approximately after 15-21 seconds Haunter will change its position to above
the victim and will crush it if the victim is NOT looking at it at this stage.
