The Bladewood Grove

It is a specimen of a unique type of tree. The tree is similar in appearance to Japanese Sakura,
 or cherry blossoms. They bear no fruit, and the only known way of reproduction is
 by careful "own root" propagation using cut saplings from an older sample.

The petals are a light pinkish color, and with a texture of smooth glass. Care must be taken when handling the petals,
 as their edges are razor sharp, and can easily slice through flesh; same applies to leaves.
The wood and bark are a light grayish color, with a texture expected of wood.
However, the petals and wood of these trees are much harder than most natural or man-made substances.
 Despite this hardness, the wood and petals are quite supple and are as pliable as most woods are.
  Both are notoriously difficult to work due to their properties, but under high temperatures,
  separate pieces are capable of being fused together. They make excellent armor, weapons and tools.
  Due to the slow growth of the plants, the material is slow to harvest.

 143-logs can be smelted into Processed Logs. These can be crafted with petals into Sturdy Material.
 Sturdy material can then be crafted into a set of sturdy armor or sturdy tools.
