The Coffee Machine

It ppears to be a standard coffee vending machine, the only noticeable difference being an entry
 touchpad with buttons corresponding to an English QWERTY keyboard.
A player can get any potion or liquid from it: if a player is holding a bucket,
 glass bottle or more than 2 iron ingots, it will open its GUI.
 There will be a selection of all available potions and liquids in the game.
