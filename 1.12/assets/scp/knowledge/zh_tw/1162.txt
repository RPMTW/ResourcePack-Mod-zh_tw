A Hole in the Wall

 It is a hole in the cinderblock wall. It measures approximately 14.5 centimeters across,
and has a variable depth which changes based on the current user. A portion of cinderblock is currently visible through
 the hole; however, no light source has been able to illuminate any portion of the interior beyond that,
 the hole always appears to be dark.

 SCP-1162 is activated when a sentient being reaches into the hole to the depth that the girth of their arm allows,
  at which point their fingers touch a solid surface similar in feel to the current location of SCP-1162,
   and they discover an item small enough to fit through the hole below their fingertips.
   These items have universally been recognized as something that the user has lost, or was searching for at some
   point during their life. However, upon retrieval of the item, another item will vanish from the person of
   the subject. In addition, any object placed into SCP-1162 will disappear as soon as it is no longer in contact with a person.
   If a player attempts to reach inside while his inventory is empty, he will receive almost fatal damage, nausea,
    blindness and slowness.
