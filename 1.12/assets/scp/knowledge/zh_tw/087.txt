The Stairwell

This is a platform staircase. Players inside the stairwell will become anxious and unable to place any
 blocks inside. Flashlight won't work there, as well as Night vision goggles. If a player reaches the bottom, he can
 find a chest with some loot, and might trigger spawning of SCP-087-1, which is hostile.
