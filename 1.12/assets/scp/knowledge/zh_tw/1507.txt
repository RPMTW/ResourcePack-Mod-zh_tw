 Pink Flamingo

  It's a pink plastic lawn flamingo. Instances of SCP-1507 have the same behavior patterns as a normal
 specimen of Phoenicopterus ruber, but do not require feeding. Instances of SCP-1507 are vulnerable to the same
 forces as ordinary plastic would be, such as heat and pressure.
 Flamingos are able to multiply over time; they are hostile to humans.
