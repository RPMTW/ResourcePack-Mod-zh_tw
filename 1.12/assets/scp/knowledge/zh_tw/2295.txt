The Bear with a Heart of Patchwork

This is a small patchwork stuffed bear who heals badly injured humans - that is, with less than 66% of health remaining.
To initiate a heal, the human must position himself within 2 blocks of range from the bear.
The bear has lower health than a player; it can heal itself by consuming dropped string, wool and lead within 2 block range.
