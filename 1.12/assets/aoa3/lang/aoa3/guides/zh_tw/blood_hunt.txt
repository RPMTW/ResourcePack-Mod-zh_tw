Blood Hunt (Event)

"The hunt for blood has begun!"
Adventurers beware, the blood hunt is upon us.
Blood hunt is a nightly event that can happen on some nights in the overworld. When it begins, you will receive the above message - that's your cue to take cover!

During the blood hunt, hostile creatures originating from the Abyss break out of their dimension and into ours, seeking to spread the blood of stray adventurers.
Don't worry though, they don't want to drink your blood; only to spread it across the grass you walk on and celebrate your demise.

These abyssal creatures prefer to stay in the dark, so once the sun rises they will stop pouring into the world, ending the blood hunt until they break through again.
