Extraction (Skill)

Ever wondered if all those dead adventurers in the bottom of the lava leave behind anything useful? Well here's your chance to find out!
Extraction is a skill based around 'extracting' items from lava. This is not an easy task, as while it may seem like lava is a watery liquid, it's actually very thick and sludge-like.

To get started, you're going to need to craft yourself an extraction device. This device is the key to drawing the goods out of a source of lava.
Place it down wherever you want, and empty some lava onto the top of the device. Runoff lava won't work as that doesn't contain any of the items; it has to be the source of the lava.
The device will pull it in and begin to work. To operate the device, use a bowl of some kind to let the device deposit the loot into, and the remaining lava will solidify into obsidian below it.

You'll need to clear away the obsidian blockages to continue using the device.
Each time you successfully extract something, you'll learn a little bit more about the best techniques and timings, and you'll start to be able to retrieve more valuable and delicate items from the molten sludge.

Eventually, you'll be extracting very valuable things, like precious gems, potions, and friendship.
Just kidding, potions won't survive in the lava.
