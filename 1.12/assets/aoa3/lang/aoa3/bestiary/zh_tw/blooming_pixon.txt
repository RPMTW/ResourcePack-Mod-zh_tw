The Blooming Pixon is another variant of the wandering Pixons, found throughout Mysterium.
Its deep purple colouring catches the eye of nearby creatures causing it to be quite noticeable.

Like all other pixons, when siphoned with a stone or diamond bowl, they drop a condensed formation of their energy in form of blooming infusion stones.
