A polar member of the Ursa family, these creatures differ surprisingly little from their woodland cousins. Often these are spotted from afar due to their eyes; while they contain the same retinal profile as Black Ursas, their bright white coat accentuates their bright red colouring.
While they are omnivores like all Ursas, due to the environmental challenges of providing flora in snowy areas, Polar Ursa diets comprise of a lot more meat than plants.

Similar to their relatives, they will chase stray creatures and people down for food, as they are rarely satiated.
