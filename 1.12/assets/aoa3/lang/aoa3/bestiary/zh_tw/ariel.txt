Light and graceful, the Ariel walks the Lands of Runandor, defending it from any potential invaders. It appears to have wings of some kind, though they're filled with too many holes to be able to actually take flight.
Despite appearing humanoid, Ariels actually have no relation to humans, and its similarities are coincidental.

They will attack any invaders on sight, and are quite strong despite their delicate appearance.
