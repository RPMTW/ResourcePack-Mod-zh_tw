The desert-evolved variant of Charger birds. Like all chargers, due to their high adaptability, they are adept at moving through their environment with their large legs. Unlike most other charger adaptions, the Desert Charger hasn't adapted their feathers and skin to match their environment. Instead, they usually appear different naturally due to sand, dirt, and dust being blended into their hair and covering their skin.

Like all chargers, these will aggressively attack by charging their bodies into the target at high speed and using their beak as a weapon.
