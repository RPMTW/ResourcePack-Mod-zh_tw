The Hill Charger is another variant of the charger family of birds. Primarily residing in hot, dry, hilly areas, the hill charger can generally be distinguished from normal chargers by their sunburnt skin and hair.

Like most other chargers, they will attack unprovoked at high speed, utilising their sharp beak to inflict damage.
