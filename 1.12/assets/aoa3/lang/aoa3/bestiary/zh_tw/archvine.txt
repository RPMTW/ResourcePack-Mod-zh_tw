Archvines are yet another mutated Gardencian creature, this one originally being a carnivorous trapping plant.
When walking, its feet deploy roots into the ground and break them off with each step. It uses these roots to draw nutrients from the ground wherever it stands.

Like all other mutated Gardencian creatures, the Archvine is extremely aggressive. Due to their greatly increased regenerative powers as a result of their rooting mechanism, Archvines are very resistant to attack and will prove very dangerous to even experienced fighters.
