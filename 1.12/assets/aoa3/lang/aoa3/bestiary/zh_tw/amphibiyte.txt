An unusually evolved entity, the Amphibiyte is a short quadrupedal creature that lives primarily in or around water.
Despite thriving in aquatic environments, it has vertically flapping wings on either side of its torso, however does not possess the ability to fly.

Being very territorial, Amphibiytes will attack any unfamiliar creature that comes near its cave, charging relentlessly at its target and using its purple barbs to attack.

It is recommended to avoid approaching from the water, as they are able to travel extremely quickly through it.

Due to their surprisingly blubbery flesh, they are well protected from untrained attacks. Only those trained well enough in combat will understand how to properly take on this creature.
