Inexplicably lightweight, this flying creature gives off the faint smell of bubblegum when nearby. It appears to carry around a large air sack on its head, possibly allowing it to be carried along by air currents.
When poked, its air sack feels soft and brittle; though it does seem to distract potential predators from harming it, as it hides its real head underneath.

When threatened, it fires extremely hard pellets that are manufactured by its own body at potential threats.
