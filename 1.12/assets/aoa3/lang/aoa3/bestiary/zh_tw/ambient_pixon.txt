The brightest of the pixons, this one seems to appear across multiple dimensions. This fact has led scientists to believe that pixons aren't actually living creatures, but instead animated energy from somewhere within the dimension itself.

Like all other pixons, when siphoned with a stone or diamond bowl, they drop a condensed formation of their energy in form of ambient infusion stones.
