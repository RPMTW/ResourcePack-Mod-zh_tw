			<link ref="main:index_01" color="#CC3333">&lt;- 01: Getting Started</link>
			<p>Before using this mod, remember to carefully check the config file to set your favourite options. A lot of concepts can be configured to make the game easier/harder or to enable/disable specific parts. Give also a look into the Core module config for additional settings.</p>
		</page>
		<page id="quest_01_02">
			<link ref="main:index_01" color="#CC3333">&lt;- 02: Been there, done that</link>
			<p>The first thing to do to become a mad chemist is to acquire the resources at the base of the production line. This is a mid-late game mod which relies on mass production, hence make sure you have large quantities of them by the time you approach the mod.</p>
			<p space="2" />
			<p color="#0000FF">Tasks</p>
			<p>- Collect coal, granite, redstone, iron, gold and quartz.</p>
			<p>- Collect stacks of glass.</p>
			<p>- Store up at least 8 bucket of lava to firmly fuel the very first machines.</p>
		</page>

		<page id="quest_01_03">
			<link ref="main:index_01" color="#CC3333">&lt;- 03: They are minerals!</link>
			<p>The entire mod production bases itself on one single ore that will be little by little acknlowledged, examined and processed.</p>
			<p space="2" />
			<p color="#0000FF">Tasks</p>
			<p>- Collect stacks of Uninspected Minerals.</p>
		</page>

		<page id="quest_01_04">
			<link ref="main:index_01" color="#CC3333">&lt;- 04: I, Rabbit</link>
			<p>The goal of the mod is to assembly a huge factory working on its own in most of its parts. This means that machines, storage and connections will cover several chunks.</p>
			<p space="2" />
			<p color="#0000FF">Tasks</p>
			<p>- Get some space, a lot of space.</p>
		</page>

		<page id="quest_01_05">
			<link ref="main:index_01" color="#CC3333">&lt;- 05: Better with conduits</link>
			<p>Since the mod moves around a lot of material, expecially fluids, it is better to use some advanced transport systems to make life easier and the factory more efficient, taking advantage of the bundles, filtering and bidirectional I/O in the same line. Although any pipe should be fine (the mod itself has an experimental one just in case), it is HIGHLY recommended to use EnderIO Conduits or Refined Storage.</p>
			<p space="2" />
			<p color="#0000FF">Tasks</p>
			<p>- Get access to the EnderIO Conduits and/or Refined Storage</p>
		</page>

		<page id="quest_02_01">
			<link ref="main:index_01" color="#CC3333">&lt;- 01: Under pressure</link>
			<p>Most of the machines are made of the same parts, eventually from different material. They are all shaped in the same machine. Use JEI as reference to quickly see which parts are involved the most.</p>
			<p space="2" />
			<p color="#0000FF">Tasks</p>
			<p>- Put down a Profiling Bench and use iron to cast several coils, rods, arms, casing. Use glass for glass pipes. Help yourself with hoppers to automate input and output.</p>
		</page>

		<page id="quest_02_02">
			<link ref="main:index_01" color="#CC3333">&lt;- 02: Never enough water</link>
			<p>The mod consumes a lot of water. This is the time to set an infinite water pump with a storage from where machines can draw from. The mod has its own pump which can be upgraded to be more efficient. Any modded pump will be valid though.</p>
			<p space="2" />
			<p color="#0000FF">Tasks</p>
			<p>- Put down a Water Pump on top of a water source tile and start collecting water.</p>
		</page>

		<page id="quest_02_03">
			<link ref="main:index_01" color="#CC3333">&lt;- 03: Getting salty</link>
			<p>Another largely used resource is salt. It is obtained by letting water evaporate inside a tank. It's not a very fast procedure and also is influenced by weather, so a group of tanks will help to put together decent amounts. Remember to refine the salt before using it.</p>
			<p space="2" />
			<p color="#0000FF">Tasks</p>
			<p>- Put down several Evaporation Tanks and a Seasoning Rack. Remember the top of the tank must see the sky.</p>
			<p>- Connect the water storage to the tanks to constantly fill them.</p>
			<p>- Connect the tanks to the Rack with hoppers or pipes to extract and refine the salt.</p>
		</page>

		<page id="quest_02_04">
			<link ref="main:index_01" color="#CC3333">&lt;- 04: A wiki for fluids</link>
			<p>Since a lot of containers may require filtering, take some time to craft a Fluidpedia. Inside it you can pick samples of any fluid or gas to set filters in tanks and vessels by using a Sampling Ampoule. This means you won't need a filled bucket to be able to set a filter.</p>
			<p space="2" />
			<p color="#0000FF">Tasks</p>
			<p>- Put down a Fluidpedia.</p>
			<p>- Craft a Sampling Ampoule and use it on any of the shown fluids/gases.</p>
			<p>- Check the tooltip of the gui and the ampoule to get familiar with the given informations.</p>
			<p>- When needed, use the ampoule with the sample in the proper filter slot to lock the access to the tank.</p>
		</page>

		<page id="quest_02_05">
			<link ref="main:index_01" color="#CC3333">&lt;- 05: Hello World</link>
			<p>Since gases are distributed internally to the mod through its own pipeline, it is possible to create an interface to allow other mods to pick them as normal fluids. With a CraftTweaker script is possible to allow single gases to be recognized by any fluid pipe. At the same way a new gas can be inserted in the opposite way. It also allows to uniform identical fluid/gases from different mods into one type.</p>
			<p space="2" />
			<p color="#0000FF">Tasks</p>
			<p>- Put down a Transposer.</p>
			<p>- Connect a Gas Pipeline on its plugs and any fluid pipe on any side to transpose the material.</p>
		</page>

		<page id="quest_02_06">
			<link ref="main:index_01" color="#CC3333">&lt;- 06: Farewell World</link>
			<p>In case a fluid or gas is not needed or it is exceeding the storage, it is possible to get rid of it by voiding it forever.</p>
			<p space="2" />
			<p color="#0000FF">Tasks</p>
			<p>- Put down a Chemical Dumper.</p>
			<p>- Add a filter in the gui using a Sampling Ampoule.</p>
			<p>- Connect a Gas Pipeline on the input plug or a fluid pipe on any side to receive the material.</p>
		</page>

		<page id="quest_03_01">
			<link ref="main:index_02" color="#CC3333">&lt;- 01: The dark matter</link>
			<p>The mod has a own (though optional) fueling system, that provides both fuel and energy to each machine, running on Syngas. Producing and storing it will be a good start. This is a little plant dedicated to Syngas making. Since Syngas is used for fueling and as process ingredient, you better keep separated the two lines and storages.</p>
			<p space="2" />
			<p color="#0000FF">Tasks</p>
			<p>- Assembly a Mineral Sizer and crush some coal blocks into cracked coal. Select the right Comminution level to expose the correct output.</p>
			<p>- Spend some buckets of lava to feed the Power Station.</p>
			<p>- Connect the Collector to a storage to keep the machine always free to run.</p>
		</page>

		<page id="quest_03_02">
			<link ref="main:index_02" color="#CC3333">&lt;- 02: Darker and stickier</link>
			<p>The mixture of cracked coal needs now to be turned into a slurry to be ready for the burner. The block required for this task could work slower than the upcoming steps so it is suggested to put down a group of several units to increase the produced amount.</p>
			<p space="2" />
			<p color="#0000FF">Tasks</p>
			<p>- Put down several Slurry Ponds.</p>
			<p>- Connect the Cracked coal storage into them to supply the mixture.</p>
			<p>- Connect the water storage into them to supply the fluid.</p>
			<p>- Optionally hook all the Ponds into one storage for larger collection.</p>
			<p>- If you have a Rotten Flesh farm, consider including it also in the process.</p>
		</page>

		<page id="quest_03_03">
			<link ref="main:index_02" color="#CC3333">&lt;- 03: Smoke on the water</link>
			<p>The produced slurry is now ready to be burned for the first stage of the Syngas making. The structure heats up to a threashold, so it's better to keep it always busy to avoid letting it cool down and then heated again. This plant will also leave behind some byproducts that will turn useful later on.</p>
			<p space="2" />
			<p color="#0000FF">Tasks</p>
			<p>- Assembly a Gasification Plant.</p>
			<p>- Connect the Coal Slurry storage into the cistern on top to supply the burnable matter.</p>
			<p>- Connect the water storage into the burner to be steamed into the chamber.</p>
			<p>- Spend some buckets of lava to feed the Power Station.</p>
			<p>- Make sure the output Raw Syngas is quickly further processed or sent to a larger storage to avoid stopping the plant.</p>
			<p>- Make sure to pick the byproduct items from the Particulate Collector to be stored for later.</p>
		</page>

		<page id="quest_03_04">
			<link ref="main:index_02" color="#CC3333">&lt;- 04: I'm you, but cleaner</link>
			<p>The hot and dirty gas needs now to be cooled and cleaned further to be finally used. The new plant will blow this gas making sure any remaining pollutant is lost. More byproduct will come at this stage.</p>
			<p space="2" />
			<p color="#0000FF">Tasks</p>
			<p>- Assembly a Gas Purifier.</p>
			<p>- Craft a Gas Pipeline Pump and several Ducts.</p>
			<p>- Connect the Raw Syngas into the input vessel (ProTip: the input vessel can be shared with the Gasifier output, saving its transportation).</p>
			<p>- Spend some buckets of lava to feed the Power Station.</p>
			<p>- Connect the output into several Gas Holders to have the larger storage possible. Reserve some Holders for the service line to fuel the factory.</p>
			<p>- Make sure to pick the byproduct items from the Particulate Collector.</p>
		</page>

		<page id="quest_03_05">
			<link ref="main:index_02" color="#CC3333">&lt;- 05: Big Bada Boom</link>
			<p>The usage of pressurized Vessels and Holders can be dangerous because if kept for too long under pressure at full capacity, they may collapse and explode. You need to avoid blowing up your lab by adding a safety system. Not fully safe since you are handling poisonous gases but still...</p>
			<p space="2" />
			<p color="#0000FF">Tasks</p>
			<p>- Craft several Exhaust Valves.</p>
			<p>- Place a valve on top of each vessel and holder as soon as possible.</p>
			<p>- Watch out if the critical point is reached. The valve will release part of the contained gas, which may poison you.</p>
		</page>

		<page id="quest_04_01">
			<link ref="main:index_02" color="#CC3333">&lt;- 01: Removing heroBrine</link>
			<p>This stage involves the salt making process again. It takes to place another group of Evaporation Tanks but this time you don't need the whole process to be done but an intermediate fluid to be extracted. What you need is the Saturated Brine stage of the evaporation.</p>
			<p space="2" />
			<p color="#0000FF">Tasks</p>
			<p>- Put down several Evaporation Tanks. Right click them with the mod wrench until selecting the purging of the Saturated Brine (look at Hwyla for reference).</p>
			<p>- Connect the water storage to the tanks to constantly fill them.</p>
			<p>- Connect the tank to a storage to extract the Saturated Brine when formed.</p>
			<p>- ProTip: Unremoved Saturated Brine will continue to evaporate as usual into the next stages.</p>
		</page>

		<page id="quest_04_02">
			<link ref="main:index_02" color="#CC3333">&lt;- 02: Two fluids, one tank</link>
			<p>It's now time to produce the main fluids that will be used for the progression. The first one is the Sodium Hydroxide and involves a simple structure that produces acids by the reaction of two fluids.</p>
			<p space="2" />
			<p color="#0000FF">Tasks</p>
			<p>- Assembly an Electrochemical CSTR.</p>
			<p>- Set a filter for Saturated Brine and water on the Input System tanks, following the displacement for left/right tank from JEI.</p>
			<p>- Connect the Saturated Brine and water storage to the Input System.</p>
			<p>- Connect the lower tank to a larger storage to keep the structure working.</p>
			<p>- ProTip: you can avoid to install the Pressure Vessel because not required for this specific recipe.</p>

		<page id="quest_04_03">
			<link ref="main:index_02" color="#CC3333">&lt;- 03: That's fine enough</link>
			<p>To use the next machine you need to prepare a fine mixture of various materials, that will be part of the upcoming reactions. These mixtures, as well as others in the future, are made into a blender.</p>
			<p space="2" />
			<p color="#0000FF">Tasks</p>
			<p>- Assembly three Lab Blenders.</p>
			<p>- Set the tanks filter to accept only the assigned item to produce Sulfuric, Chloride and Fluoride compounds.</p>
			<p>- Collect the output into a chest or a network that will represent the solid ingredient storage for the Lab Oven.</p>

			<p>The next machine will allow you to produce other fluids with the ability to serialize them and run on itself by cycling ingredients.</p>
			<p space="2" />
			<p color="#0000FF">Tasks</p>
			<p>- Assembly a Lab Oven.</p>
			<p>- Open the Server and write, in this order, a file for each Sulfuric, Hydrochloric and Hydrofluoric Acid. Make sure the amount of Sulfuric Acid is enough to be used by the other recipes.</p>
			<p>- Put down several Fluid Tanks and filter each one to receive one of the involved fluids. Connect them to the Input System with a conduit making sure it can insert and extract.</p>
			<p>- Connect the Output System back to the tanks with a conduit, making sure fluids can only be extracted from the system.</p>
			<p>- Connect a chest for all the solid ingredients on top of the oven, making sure the conduit can insert and extract.</p>
			<p>- Turn the Server and the Oven ON in this order to start.</p>

			<link ref="main:index_02" color="#CC3333">&lt;- 05: Slimes of doom</link>
			<p>Storing acids and hazardous fluids in the mod tanks may lead to pollutant leaking. This will create patches of Toxic Slurry around the tanks. Be warned that this slurry will germinate Toxic Slimes that will attack and poison you. This is an internal RH feature. It will not happen with tanks from other mods.</p>
			<p space="2" />
			<p color="#0000FF">Tasks</p>
			<p>- Store the tanks in an isolated and protected area. Remove as soon as possible the Toxic Slurry eventually leaking.</p>
			<p>- Later on, replace the normal tanks with Containment Tanks which will safely contain the hazardous fluids.</p>
