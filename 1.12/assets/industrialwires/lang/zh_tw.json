The multiblock is formed by hitting one of the upper heavy engineering blocks with an Engineer's hammer.<br>§lMechanical§r: Some components have a maximum speed (specified in radians per second). If this speed is exceeded or the multiblock is broken while turning at more than 10%% of the maximum speed (5%% for the part being broken) the component will fail violently, usually damaging nearby objects in the process. The <link;industrialwires.mech_mb_parts;speedometer;6> can be used to check the speed of a mechanical multiblock. Due to slight friction the multiblock will slow down over time, by 5%% per hour.<br>§lElectrical§r: Electricity is transfered in contiguous sections of parts that can interact with electricity. Only one type of electricity will be transferred in each section.<br>Both AC and DC come in two major variants: Single-phase and Four-phase. Four phase electricity is required for most high-power parts. AC power has an additional property: synchronous or asynchronous (relative to the speed of the multiblock). This is only relevant for rectifying/ commutating parts: Power added from outside sources is asynchronous, AC power produced in the multiblock (by coils or by commutation of DC) is synchronous. Only synchronous AC can be rectified (converted to DC) using mechanical multiblocks, attempting to rectify asynchronous AC will produce an unusable waveform. If the speed of the multiblock is within 10%% of 20 radians/second both types of AC are equal: At this speed mechanical rectification work on asynchronous AC power.<br>§lEnergy storage§r: As mentioned earlier one of the main uses of mechanical multiblocks is as energy storage. The stored energy (in joules, one joule is <config;d;iwFluxPerJoule> Flux) can be calculated as 0.5*I*w² where w is the speed of the multiblock (in radians/second) and I is the moment of inertia.
