	"I found a blueish glowing Crystal. After some analyses I would categorize this as an metallic semiconducting crystal.",
	"Creation:",
	"The crystals grow, like most crystalline structures, under heat and pressure. As such, they are only found underground. Usually they form within a sandy, fertile soil, which has similar characteristics to the crystals.",
	"Refinement:",
	"Different from diamonds, the crystal structures are mostly composed of silicon, preventing them from burning at high temperatures. The melting point is 1.400°C. The materials can be refined by heating them up with a reducing agent, like carbon in form of coal or gas. By this process the crystals are transformed into handy ingots.",
	"Characteristics:",
	"The neon materials work best at about 100°C. But they have a very low annealing temperature, so the most of them start to glow at around 18 - 32°C. This is a very unique characteristic and from it, I gave the name neoncrystal for the blue one I found. The world is vast; there must be more types of crystals."
