	"One of the plants that are native to Tyros seems to me to be very useful. The plant forms fibrous stems up to 2 meters high and, depending on the growth phase, can harvest a lot of organic material in the form of flowers, compost or plant fibers.",
	"It also makes edible tubers that resemble potato. Overall the plant is a very rich source of biomass and food."
