    "I have noticed an interesting effect if I combine the transport chip and the ultimate chip.",
    "While the ultimate chip make the  experience yield higher, the xp would  be lost if I outomate a machine, but this is not the case if both chips are installed.",
    "The ultimate chip still boost the xp amount but if an item is moved  by an transport chip the xp will drop out of the machine. I could use a T3 modul to collect them but I had a better idea.",
    "By installing a network chip the xp will directly send through the network and get stored into connected T3 modules, but they also get lost if no T3 modul is connectd or all Modules are full.",
    "Every transport chip supporting machine does also support this behaivier"
