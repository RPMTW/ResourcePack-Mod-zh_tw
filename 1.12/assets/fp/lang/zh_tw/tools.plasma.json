  "I\u0027ve developed a tool that is similar to a Bunsen burner, which generates large quantities of heat. With this, I can melt most metals; however iron and steel require much more energy. As such, a super-hot jet of plasma is used, generated by discharging the energy stored in ionized air within a special compartment. This process uses a great deal of energy.",
  "To ensure that the tool is not destroyed, a magnetic field is generated within the cutter. I should be extremely careful that there is always enough energy for the field generation.",
  "This new tool allows me to break down all kinds of metal blocks* (including almost all of the decorative blocks and machines of the Future Pack) extremely quickly. Although it does not replace any sharp tools, making it unusable for rock for example.",

  "Neon energy is needed for (re-)charging. If the energy reserves are exhausted, the plasma cutter will be destroyed.",
  "To charge the plasma cutter, I can use the corresponding slots of energy generators, battery boxes, or the Energy Research Module, just like charging a battery.",
