  "The possibilities of \"Overdrive\" are limited and only applicable to blocks with computer system. With the help of nanostructure manipulation I can manipulate every working block (ticking tileEntity) to add additional work steps.",
  "For this I have developed a machine, that can be placed on other blocks. It has a computer system and needs neon energy. A single external processing unit at a clock rate of 100% doubles the block\u0027s speed.",
