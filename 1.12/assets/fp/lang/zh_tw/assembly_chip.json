	"I have managed to create a simple machine with my basic knowledge of chip-crafting, which gives me ideal conditions for assembling these components.",
	"The main unit is made up of a metal frame with various pieces of machinery for part assembly and testing. Additionally, the unit makes it possible to perform the crucial assembly steps in a sanitary environment, which has proven to be imperative for the continued functioning of the component.",
	"Crafting:",
	{"link":"fp:lang/part/cr_assembly_table.json"},
	
	"Usage:",
	"Any item created here consists of 3 components, which are placed in the central 3 slots. Their order is of importance! The finished product can be taken from the big slot beneath.",
	
	"Component Quality:",
	"Although the assembly conditions may be optimal, the quality of an actual component can't be fully predicted. As such, a randomized value for the Core/RAM/Chip power is created upon assembly, based off a minimum value set by the recipe used.",
	"The maximum value usually is only slightly higher than minimum value, but can be increased noticeably by supplying energy and/or Support. (Support points become available with further research).",
	"Note: There are some situations and recipes in which supplied energy/Support is wasted or isn't needed."
