  "I developed a machine to pull Items from another block\u0027s inventory. This invention is all in all a combination of a hopper and a dropper.",
  "The Item Pusher can be aligned in all of the 6 directions. The input is marked with a green arrow and the output with a black dot. If the machine is triggered by a Redstone pulse, it transfers a Stack of Items from the block in front of the input side to the output side. (Can also be an inventory)",
