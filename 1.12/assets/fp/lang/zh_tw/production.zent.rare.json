  "On Menelaus there seemed to be strong rainstorms long ago. In what remains of ancient lakes, I found some interesting mineral deposits.",
  "These deposits appear to contain rare materials in concentrated areas. It would be quite beneficial to remove the deposits and extract these rare elements.",
  "These rare elements can be separated by elaborate extraction methods, providing lithium, gadolinium, and neodymium. Other materials can be found occasionally, however these three are the most useful for how expensive and time-consuming the process can be.",
