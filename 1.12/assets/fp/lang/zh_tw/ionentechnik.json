	"Electricity also exists in the open air, which is especially evident during thunderstorms. Oftentimes, charged particles can be found floating in the air. They are incomplete atoms, which I call ions.",
	"The material called plasma that I already know well is a gas with large amount of such ions. I should continue to study these particles to understand conductive materials better. Maybe I can also somehow collect free-floating ions from the air and convert them into usable energy."
