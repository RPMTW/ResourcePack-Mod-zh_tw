	"Applying nano-manipulation technology, I have developed a new type of laser tower. With the help of a built-in computer, the tower automatically targets all creatures and players within its range. With a very precise laser beam, the tower will heal the targets.",
	"In doing so, the tower consumes large amounts of neon energy, which is why I should connect it to a more permanent source of energy. In addition to the continuous consumption of the computer monitoring system, the healing of an entity requires additional energy (10 NE per life point).",

	"The laser turret is controlled by a computer system which, among other things, regulates the target acquisition and the energy flow.",
	"Supported Chipsets:",
	"Industrial Chipset: Reduces the energy needed to heal creatures.",
	"Tactical Control Chipset: Increases the target search radius.",
	"AI Chipset: Advanced configuration with GUI!"
