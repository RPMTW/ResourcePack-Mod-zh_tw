	"I came to the conclusion that small quartz crystals can be used as both a clock generator and for permanent storage of input information alike.",
	"In combination with some controlling logic, as well as silicon and some energy conductors made from copper, I developed a universal chipset, which mainly functions as a bridge between a processor and the outside world.",
	"Furthermore, this logic chipset contains basic code for the processor, which allows the system to boot. So for the time being, every system will need one of these chipsets.",
	"Assembly:",
	{"link":"fp:lang/part/as_chip.logic.json"},
	
	"A logic chipset of high quality (high chip power) has no benefits compared to a normal one!",
		
	"Info:",
	"Chipsets possess 2 critical properties: Their performance (§lchippower§r), which indicates the power of their effect, and their cost (§lcorepower§r), which indicates the performance needed from the processor."
