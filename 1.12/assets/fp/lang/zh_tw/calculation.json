	"Energy research needs a lot of computing power, which unfortunately the researcher does not have. That's why the research is getting to be very time consuming.",
	"So I invented a calculations module, which will help the researcher to perform complex calculations. Because this module doesn't need a lot of different chipsets, I was able to modify the system to include more RAM slots. I have also included a second, interconnected processor to process the data faster. Thus this system can utilize more corepower than normal machines.",
	"The calculations module has to be directly connected to the researcher or connected via a network. (Networks potentially have yet to be researched.)",
	"It is possible to connect any number of modules to a researcher, whereby one module with 100% RAM has 4 times the calculation power of a normal researcher. The power of a module depends only on its RAM power.",

	"Currently, I should be able to attach 1-2 modules to a researcher."
