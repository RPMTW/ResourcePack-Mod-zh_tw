	"I have spotted an edible plant on the surface, which is perfectly adapted to the local environment. This plant posseses a very good ability of extracting nutrients from the lean soil. As such, the Mendelberry is also able to extract nutrients from the crystal sands. I can use this ability to convert Glowtite Sand or Retium Sand into clean Neon Sand, by growing a Mendelberry bush on it."
