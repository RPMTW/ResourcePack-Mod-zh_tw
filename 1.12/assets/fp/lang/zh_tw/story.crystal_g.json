	"I have found a glowing yellow crystal. It emits more light than most other crystals and by my analysis, I would categorize it as a non-metallic semiconducting crystal.",
	"It seems to glow brighter due to a high glowstone content in the crystal structure. As such, I give this specimen the name Glowtite."
