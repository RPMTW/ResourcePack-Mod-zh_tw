	"While analyzing the latest generation of my machines, I noticed that they often don't use the most efficient crafting methods or waste material remains.",
	"Through minor adaptations of their programming, I made it so they can analyse and document their own efficiency. The data created this way are stored as \"Support\" points inside the machine.",
	"I can evaluate the data sets gathered from these \"intelligently\" working machines in my own later research or use the data to create even more intelligent machinery.",
	"Also, if supplied with Support, I can use the assembly table to build considerably better components.",
	"Info: The Support Gauge is a yellow meter, usually found on the right-hand side of a machine's GUI. Information regarding the transport and storage of said points can be found on the \"Logistics\" page.",
	"Note: New researchables available in \"Logistics\"!",
