  "I have developed a sturdy glass and metal tank, that can hold up to 8 buckets of liquid. The tanks can be placed side by side and one on top of another to construct a larger tank.",
  "For filling, a pipe can be connected to any side. The tank can be emptied without a pump by connecting a pipe to the bottom.",
