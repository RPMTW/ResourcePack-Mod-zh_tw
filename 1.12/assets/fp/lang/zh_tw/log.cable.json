  "I\u0027ve made a prototype of an Energy conductor. A combination of crystalline and refined Neon has resulted in the optimal conductor.",
  "This design is very unstable and prone for environmental impacts, so I covered it in an aluminum case.",
  "The cable can be placed free standing. I don\u0027t have to care about overloading or such things, because the neon conductors can transport gigantic amounts of energy without having traditional problems like voltage and current.",
