	"Using my studies in the field of thermodynamics, I developed an upgrade module for all computer-aided systems.",
	"I can attach this module to each side of the machine, where it then releases heat to the environment. Depending on environmental temperature (biome), 1-3 additional heatpoints can be derived permanently.",
	"The cooling efficiency is shown by a blue (3), green (2) or red (1) light at the cooler.",
