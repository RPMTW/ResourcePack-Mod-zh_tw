	"I can now decipher the exact nature of the crystals I found.",
	"The neon crystal has a pure, basic form, consisting of a relatively weak crystalline silicon structure. It is interesting to note that this is not what is responsible for the apparent properties of the neon materials.",
	"The special properties are actually produced by tiny, almost indescructible spheres of silicon, which enclose an atomic bitripentium, stabilized only by its silicon sheathing. When this casing breaks, the particle disintegrates, releasing gigantic amounts of energy.",
	"This breakdown however, also radiates miniscule particles, charged from their stable state. Sometimes they are absorbed by the crystal structure and radiate energy as visible light. When energized, this particle can change into even more unstable energy states depending on how it strikes a stable state. The energy released is extremely clean and efficient, delivering nearly all the energy possible in the reaction. This seems to explain how my existing energy storage systems and neon-based storage systems function.",
	"The different colors seen are created by the incorporation of different impurities into the surrounding silicon structure."
