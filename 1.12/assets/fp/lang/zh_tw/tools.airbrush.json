  "I created a tool to color my composite metal blocks.",
  "It\u0027s an airbrush, which accelerates the material in the storage tank and disperses it evenly. The device is able to color blocks, but also to sandblast them to remove coloring. To do this I must use sand or gravel.",

  "Usage:",
  "§lsShift + right click§r opens the airbrush inventory, where I can insert a color tank or Sand/Gravel.",
  "§lright click§r on an Metal/Grid - Block to brush. By sandblasting blocks, they return to their uncolored state. By using a color tank it is colored with the corresponding color.",
  "You can read in a block\u0027s research information if it is colorable or not. (As well as by simply trying).",
  "Note: A colored block can\u0027t be recolored directly, you have to sandblast it first."
