	"By developing repeatable, well-documented production processes, I can produce special materials and even save resources.",
	"To create the equipment for these processes is a minor issue, and by slightly improving my old systems, I can create such machines.",
	"A large amount of information about various materials is necessary to perform more complicated processes, however I can use the analysis data of my simpler machines to help with this.",
	"To direct the support points into a machine, I need to develop additional technology. Currently I cannot accommodate a download destination for flash storage in these complex machines",
