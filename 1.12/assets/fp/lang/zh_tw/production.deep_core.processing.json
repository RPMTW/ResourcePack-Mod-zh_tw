	"To get the miner up and running, the Rift must first be scanned by placing a white lens into the top slot. The remaining durability of the active lens is displayed to the left of the slot. The progress bar for the current cycle is shown at the center.",
	"When the first cycle (with white lens) is completed, the lens can be removed again via the button directly underneath the lens slot. In the tooltip of the Bedrock Rift (bottom of the GUI) the fill rate as well as the ore distribution can be read off. The ore distribution results from the ores that were originally generated in the surroundings of the crack and can not be affected.",
	"§lMining:§r To mine ores, red lenses must be inserted. When a cycle is completed, the fill rate determines if the cycle was successful. If successful, a ore is randomly picked from the ore distribution and stored to the inventory. Every successful cycle destabilizes the Rift, thus reducing the fill rate.",
	"§lRegeneration:§r With the help of green lenses, the Rift can be stabilized. After each cycle, the fill rate increases by 5%, but support points are needed.",
	"§lChipsets:§r\n§0Industrial Chipset:§r Increases the amount of ore per cycle, significantly increases the damage to the Rift \n§0Tactic Control Chipset:§r Mining with Silk-Touch\n§0Support Chipset:§r Produces support points on every mined ore, increases cycle time\n§0Navigation Chipset:§r Enables Filter*, increases cycle time\n§0AI Chipset:§r Reduces the wear of the lenses\n§0Ultimate und Network Chipset:§r Generates experience points",
	"§lFilter:§r Only ores are mined that correspond to the filter (3 slots in the middle). Cycles that do not yield suitable ore are considered as unsuccessful and the crack is not damaged. This does NOT increase the chance of corresponding ores."
