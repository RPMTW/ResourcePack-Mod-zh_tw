	"Through experimentation, I realized that some materials have good thermal conductivity while other ones prevent any heat exchange whatsoever.",
	"The limit of all my current systems is temperature control, which means that a processor with a very high processing load produces more heat than the casing can disperse. Therefore I have developed a cooling system that can be applied to the outside of a machine's casing.",
