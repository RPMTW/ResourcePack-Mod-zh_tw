	"With the help of my deadly lasers, I have developed a type of guard tower. With the help of a built-in computer, it automatically targets all creatures within its range. With a very strong laser beam, the guard tower will rapidly injure targets.",
	"In doing so, the tower consumes large amounts of neon energy, which is why I should connect it to a more permanent source of energy. In addition to the continuous consumption of the computer monitoring system, the killing of an entity requires additional energy (10 NE per life point).",

	"The laser turret is controlled by a computer system which, among other things, regulates the target acquisition and the energy flow.",

	"Industrial Chipset: Reduces the energy needed to kill creatures.",
	"Tactical Control Chipset: Increases the target search radius.",
	"AI Chipset: Advanced configuration with GUI !",
	"Ultimate Chipset: The killed entities will drop XP.",
	"Logistic Chipset: The dropped items will get transported to the laser."
