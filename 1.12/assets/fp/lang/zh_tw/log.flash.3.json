	"Despite my research I was so far not able to develop a better storage unit based on redstone cells. But I did discover a new approach. It is based on the fact that the electric properties of glowstones change if they are exposed to a strong impulse of Neon Energy. Thanks to the new design these storage cells are much smaller than redstone storage cells which allowed me to considerably increase their capacity.",
