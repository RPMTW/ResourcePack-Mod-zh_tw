	"I developed a very bright light source. It consists of a bulletproof glass case with the air drawn out. Inside, neon energy flows through a suitable coil to stimulate extremely finely-ground neon dust. Combined with active Redstone dust, it starts an interesting reaction, which emits a huge amount of light.",
	"Because of its construction, both neon energy as well as a Redstone signal are required to power it.",

	"A Redstone-coated neon wire would be especially suitable for its energy supply."
