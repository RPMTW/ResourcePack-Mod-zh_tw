	"By precisely focusing a laser beam, I can manipulate materials at even the atomic level.",
	"With this technology, I can change both organic and inorganic structures. Inanimate structures actually prove to be more difficult because they do not regenerate themselves or have any specific blueprint; but this can be compensated for with support points.",
	"Laser manipulation allows me to create and break atomic bonds between atoms using targeted pulses of energy, so it's also possible for me to rearrange the structure.",
	"I should be very careful applying this knowledge outside of a lab setting.",
	"Note: New research is available on in \"Space\" and \"Production\"!"
