	"Tyros is a hot jungle planet with numerous water bodies. The world is quite flat and hilly only in a few places. All areas above the sea level are very densely overgrown with shrubs and trees. The atmosphere is quite thin and colored green by scattered organic suspended matter. In the Sky there is also the gas giant I call Nionos."
