    "I can build my spaceship in any shape and size I want, but it is important that it have a solid metal block cover, as it is this cover that transports its metal framework and all the blocks, players, and creatures that are within it.",
	"The \"Pilot\" must be in an enclosed space containing the on-board computer at the time of the jump, but the rest of the ship's structure does not have to be fully sealed.",
	"The onboard computer stores the neon energy to operate the ship's systems and should always be connected to the power generator. This should always be installed, as otherwise it is incertain if I can get enough energy for the return flight.",
	"In order to move my ship, of course, I still need some engines and fuel tanks, which I can distribute anywhere in the ship, depending on the size of the ship. I normally need one engine to transport 100 other blocks.",
	"Since I do not know the environment of my destination, I will station the ship at a high altitude, so I will also need a teleporter to reach the surface",
	"Once I have fueled my invention and I have programmed the on-board computer with the appropriate coordinates of a target, I can start my journey by initiating the jump at the onboard computer."
