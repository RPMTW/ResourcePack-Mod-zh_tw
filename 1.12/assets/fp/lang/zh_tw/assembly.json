	"As I was experimenting with neon currents, interrupting and rerouting them, I found that I could potentially build more complex control systems.",
	"For the time being, coated silicon wafers appear to be the an ideal base material. From them, I can develop an universal, computational base component, which I call a transistor.",
	"They operate fairly easily: there are separated input and output locations for energy. However if I use a current to create a electric field at the input, the material's properties change, connecting the input and output.",
	"With enough of these transistors, I could presumably create any form of logic gate or control. But first I must develop a suitable crafting station...",
