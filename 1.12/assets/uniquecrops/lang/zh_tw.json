    "uniquecrops.book.pageintro": "Hello and welcome to Unique Crops! Here in this book, you'll find information on the various different crops, and how to grow them. A general rule to remember here is that not all the crops will be grown the same way, so be sure to read up on some of them! Luck favors the prepared, or so they say, heheh. Additionally, what they drop may have various amounts of usefulness. It is completely up to you to find out what's good or not.",
    "uniquecrops.book.pagenormal": "Normalish crops. They can be grown like any other vanilla crops. Aside from being one of the ingredients used to craft this book, there is nothing special about them. Randomly drops vanilla crops when harvested.",
    "uniquecrops.book.pagecinderbella": "Based on the old folktale, these crops are quite magical: They must be planted at night, just before midnight, while surrounded on all 4 sides by pumpkins. If it is not planted in this fashion, it withers away.",
    "uniquecrops.book.pagecollis": "These crops likes being planted in high places, usually on mountains. Also, the higher up they're planted, the faster they can grow when receiving growth ticks.",
    "uniquecrops.book.pagedirigible": "These dirigible plums seems to be filled with helium, that would explain why some fully grown plums keep flying away! Best to pick up the plums when they drop as soon as possible.",
    "uniquecrops.book.pageenderlily": "These ender lilies just love to have nearby empty farmland to teleport to. Sometimes they'll even swap places with other kinds of crops. Not crops of the same type as them, though...",
    "uniquecrops.book.pageferoxia": "Much like breaking in wild horses, these savage plants all have different ways of being grown. Once planted or harvested manually, this book will keep a record of their current demands for each stage of crop growth on the next page. These crops seem to be locked to the players who planted them, so one may have to be ingame in order for them to grow. Additionally, the steps will be different once a fully grown crop is harvested.",
    "uniquecrops.book.pageinvisibilia": "Once planted, these sneaky crops will be completely invisible to anyone that doesn't happen to be wearing a certain kind of eyewear. They can be harvested normally once you can see them.",
    "uniquecrops.book.pageknowledge": "Their thirst for knowledge knows no bounds, these crops will search for nearby bookshelves around them in a small radius, then look into any chest inventory above the bookshelves for written books to eat letters from. It's good to note that they don't seem to like book copies, and won't eat from the same book twice.",
    "uniquecrops.book.pagemaryjane": "Blazing plants! These prefer the hellish environment of the Nether. Not much to say about their looks other than that they can emit a small amount of light. Once fully grown, these crops will only be successfully harvested when the harvester is on fire, else the plants themselves burst into flames and leave nothing behind.",
    "uniquecrops.book.pagemerlinia": "Like the classic book written by T.H. White, this crop appears to move backwards through time, starting at appearing fully planted, and working backwards to the youngest stage. This only happens when they're given a special kind of bonemeal.",
    "uniquecrops.book.pagemillennium": "This crop takes a very long time to grow; quite literally a millennia! I'm not even sure what they'll drop. Growth accelerators from other mods are a must.",
    "uniquecrops.book.pagemusica": "These crops will grow by dancing to the beat, note block songs, specifically. What kind of songs they'll like is completely up to you. Drops a random music disc.",
    "uniquecrops.book.pageprecision": "These bright sparkers are quite precise! So precise, that there is only a small window where they can be successfully harvested to drop anything useful. Take cues from the growth visuals.",
    "uniquecrops.book.pageweepingbells": "They're quite shy, but quite in need of your attentions. Weeping bells will only grow when you're looking directly at them. Once fully grown, do not take your eyes off of them, lest you face their wrath from your attentions being divided elsewhere.",
    "uniquecrops.book.pageeula": "They are quite possibly the most legal crops you can get. Of course, once you get past all the legal mumbo jumbo when planting every single one of them, that is.",
    "uniquecrops.book.pagedyeius": "Dye plants! Instead of planting the respective dye plants and harvesting said plant for dyes, it is all condensed in one crop, its appearance and respective drops depending on the time of day or night.",
    "uniquecrops.book.pagecobblonia": "Hardy plants! They may look a little rocky, but they can prove to be quite useful in some circumstances. Once fully grown, you may have water on one side of the soil it is on and lava on the opposite side for free cobble being given out at random.",
    "uniquecrops.book.pageabstract": "I must admit, I cheated a little in order to snag a picture of one actually planted. These crops, being just an abstract concept, will not materialize into the world as a form of \"crops\", instead taking its concept of growth from the planter as the planter plays throughout their time on the world.",
    "uniquecrops.book.pageartisia": "These plants are pretty crafty! They're the next step you need to get to in order to craft the other seeds. You'll need 9 of them in a 3x3 square, with the center one being grown last. After that, it is just a matter of dropping the desired ingredients on top of the center plant, upon which it will automatically try crafting the output once all 9 plants have the ingredients. The order you put the ingredients in doesn't matter.",
    "uniquecrops.book.pagewafflonia": "These crops like to grow together with other crops of their type, in groups of even numbers divisible by 4. Any crop with an odd-numbered of friends, including themselves, will fail to grow. Harvesting them will yield waffles, part of a delicious breakfast diet.",
    "uniquecrops.book.pagedevilsnare": "Thorny plants that grows well in darkness, they will shrink away from bright light sources. Additionally, they will try to spread to adjacent dirt/farmland once fully grown. Fully matured crops will snare and slow down any players that walk through them.",
    "uniquecrops.book.pagepixelsius": "Pixelly, pixelly pixel plants. Starting from the default 16x16 textures, these crops will gradually get more and more high definition as they grow.",
    "uniquecrops.book.pagepetramia": "Very bedrocky crops, these can only be planted and grown at below 10y. Once fully grown, they will gradually transform all bedrock around and below them into Dark Blocks, which can be picked up by shift-rightclicking them with a Ender Snooker. If mobGriefing gamemode is off, then the crops will instead yield the Dark blocks when rightclicked. The dark blocks have potential use for recipes, and are also very good witherproof blocks.",
    "uniquecrops.book.pagemalleatoris": "Crafted using anvils as part of the seed recipe, these are the renewable versions of anvils. To grow, they must have items with durability nearby. The higher the durability of these items, the better the chance they'll advance a stage. This process will consume 10%% of that item's durability. Once fully grown, right clicking it with any repairable item will restore 50%% of that item's max durability.",
    "uniquecrops.book.pageimperia": "These imperius crops are known for their strong anti mob spawning policies. Growing them up requires killing the random mobs they spawn, though. Once fully grown, they will prevent mobs from spawning in a 3x3 chunk area around them.",
    "uniquecrops.book.pagelacusia": "Lacusia crops will transport items from a to b, only along a very flat surface. When a crop next to an inventory is given a redstone signal, it will extract any items from that inventory if available, then transport it along until it finds an available inventory to insert into. When it reaches a junction, it will loop through the directions (S-W-N-E) for the first valid crop/inventory to insert into first. If the junction is given a redstone signal, it will reverse the direction to search in.",
    "uniquecrops.book.pagehexis": "Experience crops are fairly straightforward; they will not grow at all unless given experience orbs. Once grown, glass bottles can be used to collect the experience with a right-click. By doing this, there is a 50/50 chance the crop's growth will be reset. Additionally, you can spend 1 expierience level to advance the stage of the crop.",
    "uniquecrops.book.pageindustria": "Their photosynthetic process allows them to store up the sun's energy as actual stored energy. A harvest of a fully grown crop will yield beans more powerful than potatoes.",
    "uniquecrops.book.pagequarry": "This crop is so hardy, it hardly grows at all. One must mine this hard crop a few times to get it to grow. Once it is grown, it will start to mine out the chunk it is in, starting at the level it is planted on. If there is no chest above it to collect the mined blocks, it will spawn one of the blocks above it and wait until it is air. This quarry crop requires wheat crops to be planted around it, so it can then steal their attempts to grow in order to do its mining.",
