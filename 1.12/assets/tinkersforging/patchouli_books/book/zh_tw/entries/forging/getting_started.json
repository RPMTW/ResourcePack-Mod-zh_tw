Make sure that the tier of your anvil is at least as high as the tier of the item you want to create. Then you will need a method to heat up your items, some ingots to forge, and you can begin!"

However, be warned: Most items will melt if they get too hot, meaning you have to watch the temperature of your items carefully."
